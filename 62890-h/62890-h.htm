<h3>I.</h3>

<p>The short December day was drawing to
its close; but, though the month was December,
the temperature was not that which is
usually associated with the season. Instead of
gray skies, leaden waters, and brown or snowy
earth, there was a sky of glowing beauty, a
glittering sea, and a land covered with the
evergreen foliage of the South&mdash;for it was
December in Florida. At noon the sun had
shone with uncomfortable power on the broad
plaza and old Spanish houses of St. Augustine;
but now that his last rays were gilding
the ancient fort and the Moorish belfry of the
cathedral, the air was full of that delicious softness&mdash;a
caressing warmth without heat&mdash;which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
in such latitudes makes the mere fact of existence
a delight.</p>

<p>On the gray sea wall there were several
loiterers; but, as the sun finally sank, and the
purple veil of twilight fell over land and sea,
most of these departed, leaving only two girls,
who still paced the narrow promenade, talking
earnestly.</p>

<p>At least one was talking earnestly&mdash;the
other only listened. But the mere fact of listening
can be eloquent sometimes, and this
girl’s face seemed made to express all things
eloquently. It was a delicately molded face,
with a pale complexion and the most gentle
and lustrous eyes possible to imagine. As yet
she was altogether immature in appearance
and manner, being not more than fifteen years
of age, but her slender figure gave indications
of more than ordinary grace when time should
have transformed its angles into curves, just as
her face promised to prove even more than
beautiful when a woman’s soul should shine
out of those eyes, now soft as a fawn’s and innocent
as a child’s.</p>

<p>Her companion was more ordinary in appearance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
yet nine people out of ten would
have admired her most. She was an exceedingly
pretty girl, and, being four or five years
the senior of the two, possessed all the advantage
of presence and of manner which such a
difference in age at this period of life bestows.
Her face had none of the delicate regularity
of the face beside her, but her features were
charmingly piquant, her complexion brilliantly
fair, and her sunny, hazel eyes were full of
mirth. At least they were usually full of
mirth, but this evening there was a shade in
them that looked like anxiety. It was she
who had been talking for half an hour, while
the girl who clung to her arm listened with
rapt attention. As they still paced up and
down in the twilight she went on:</p>

<p>“You understand now, Aimée, how it is,
and how I am almost at my wit’s end to know
what to do. I declare it is almost enough to
make one wish one were ugly, to be tormented
as I am!”</p>

<p>“I would not wish that,” said Aimée. “It
is like a novel&mdash;only better&mdash;to be as pretty as
you are, and to know that two men love you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
to distraction; that you are almost engaged to
one, but that you love the other and are going
to elope with him&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hush!” cried the other, with a pressure
of the arm she held almost as sharp as the
tone of her voice. “Think, if somebody were
to hear you! I am <em>not</em> going to elope with
him! That is just the point. I have promised&mdash;but
I can not, I can not! I like him&mdash;of
course, I like him&mdash;but I don’t like him
well enough to ruin all my life for him, to
give up everything and break mamma’s heart.
Aimée, I can’t do it.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do, then?” asked
Aimée, while her eyes seemed to grow momently
larger and darker and more full of interest.</p>

<p>To an impressionable girl of fifteen, with
her head full of romances, all this was thrilling
beyond expression. A beautiful girl, a worldly
mother, two ardent suitors, and an elopement
planned&mdash;what could any romance furnish
better? Yet it was here in her own
every-day world, and <em>she</em> was promoted to the
dignity of receiving the confidences of the heroine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
What could life hold more exciting,
save the joy, of which she as yet hardly
dreamed, of being a heroine herself?</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” she repeated
in a voice as sweet and as full of dramatic expression
as her eyes. “If you have promised
to go to-night, how can you break your promise?”</p>

<p>“Breaking my promise does not matter at
all,” said Fanny Berrien, impatiently; “but
getting rid of Lennox Kyrle without trouble
does matter. And how it is to be done I do
not know, unless you will help me.”</p>

<p>“I will do anything&mdash;anything in the
world!” said Aimée, fervently. “But how
can you make up your mind to give him
up?”</p>

<p>“It does not exactly mean giving him up,”
said Fanny, “though I suppose it will come to
that at last,” she added with a sigh. “But
<em>just now</em> I only want him to understand that
it is quite impossible for me to go with him.
He is so impetuous and rash, he will not understand
at all how I am placed; and if I do
not meet him at the time when he expects me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
he will be quite capable of coming for me&mdash;as
he has threatened to do&mdash;and then there <em>would</em>
be a fearful state of affairs!”</p>

<p>“He must be like young Lochinvar,” said
Aimée. “I should think you would adore
such a lover as that.”</p>

<p>“He has given me more trouble than any
other man in the world, so I suppose I ought
to adore&mdash;or else hate him,” said Miss Berrien.
“Of course, you don’t understand about
these things, Aimée, and I ought not to be
talking of them to a child like you, only I
have nobody else to talk to; but Lennox
Kyrle is one of the men to whom one can’t
say no. He has more power over me than
any one else in the world, and yet I am not at
all sure that I want to marry him.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Aimée, who was drinking
in these new ideas as a plant absorbs
water.</p>

<p>“Oh, for a great many reasons,” replied the
other. “For one thing, I am not sure that I
want to be domineered over for the rest of my
life; and then he has nothing in the way of
fortune&mdash;at least nothing to speak of. Now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Aimée, you know it is not at all pleasant to
want money and not have any.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Aimée decidedly&mdash;she evidently
understood this&mdash;“it is not at all pleasant.”</p>

<p>“And Mr. Meredith is rich, and will be
richer; and he is devoted to me, and mamma
is anxious that I shall marry him, and I like
him very well&mdash;when I don’t see Lennox! So
I have nearly made up my mind not to see
him any more.”</p>

<p>There was a pause. Aimée felt that this
was a very unheroine-like decision, a lame and
impotent conclusion for a romance; but she
did not know what to say, being somewhat
confused by the multiplicity of new ideas presented
to her consideration.</p>

<p>“At all events, I can not go to-night,
though I was mad enough to promise him
that I would,” pursued the young lady desperately.
“And I can not see him; if I did, I
<em>should</em> go. I am ashamed to think how little
will of my own I have when I am with him&mdash;in
fact, I have none at all. He simply makes
me do whatever he likes. So I dare not go
to meet him, and this brings me to the point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
I have been trying to reach all this time&mdash;will
you go for me?”</p>

<p>If she had asked Aimée to spring from the
wall into the waves washing softly against it,
the girl could hardly have been more surprised.
Her face showed this plainly, but after
an instant’s hesitation she said:</p>

<p>“I will do anything that I can for you&mdash;where
do you want me to go?”</p>

<p>“It will not be pleasant at all, and I feel as
if it was very selfish to ask it of you,” said
Miss Berrien. “But then you are only a
child, and it can not compromise you as it
would compromise <em>me</em>; and you are as brave
as a lion, so you won’t be afraid to come here
after dark, will you?”</p>

<p>“<em>Here?</em>” said Aimée, glancing around.</p>

<p>“Yes, here,” answered her companion. “A
boat, with Lennox in it, will be here at midnight.
You must tell him that I can not come,
that I&mdash;But never mind, I will give the message
at the time. Will you do it for me?”</p>

<p>If Aimée’s courage failed at such a prospect,
she felt that it would never do to betray
as much. She had pledged herself to do “anything,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
and she must not fail when something
was demanded.</p>

<p>“Yes, I will do it,” she said, “if there is no
other way; but why can you not write and let
him know?”</p>

<p>“Write!” repeated the other. “Why, you
foolish child, have I not told you where he
is?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think you have,” said Aimée&mdash;conscious,
however, that in the multiplicity of
statements which had been made to her, the
particular statement relative to Mr. Kyrle’s
whereabouts might not have received due attention.</p>

<p>“He is there,” said Fanny with a comprehensive
wave of her hand toward the Atlantic
Ocean. “Did I not tell you that he is in a
yacht?”</p>

<p>“Oh! has he a yacht?” cried Aimée; “and
can you refuse to go with him?”</p>

<p>“I might not refuse if it was his own yacht&mdash;for
a man must be very rich to afford a
yacht&mdash;but it is not his own. It is borrowed
from a friend ‘for this occasion only,’” said
Fanny, with a slight laugh. “His plan is certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
very well arranged. He borrows the
yacht, as I have said, runs down here, lies off
the inlet and brings a boat up to St. Augustine
for me&mdash;I step into it, we return to the
yacht, run to Key West or Pensacola and are
married, then cruise for a month among the
West Indies. How would you like such a
programme as that, Aimée?”</p>

<p>“How would I like it?” repeated Aimée.
Words were evidently too weak to express
her sentiments; but she clasped her hands and
her eyes shone like stars. “It would be glorious!”
she cried, with a thrill in her voice.
“I never read of anything more beautiful. I
don’t believe, I <em>can’t</em> believe, but that you
mean to go.”</p>

<p>“You may believe it, then,” said Miss
Berrien, shortly. “It is very well to be romantic
when you don’t have to pay a price
for romance; but when you do, and it is such
a heavy one as a life of poverty&mdash;sailing and
love-making can’t last forever, and what is to
come after? I asked myself that question, and
the answer made me stop.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if it was not Mr. Meredith who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
made you stop?” said Aimée. “I saw the
diamonds he brought you; but, though diamonds
are very pretty, they are not as good
as a lover like young Lochinvar.”</p>

<p>“You will change your mind when you
are a little older, my dear. Lovers are plenty,
but diamonds&mdash;However, it is not certain
that I will take them. It is only certain that I
can not throw away everything by going with
Lennox to-night. He must wait.”</p>

<p>“But perhaps he won’t wait,” said Aimée.
“If he is so impetuous, perhaps he will say
that it must be this night or never.”</p>

<p>“There is no danger that he will say anything
of the kind,” replied Fanny, with a comfortable
assurance of her own power. “He
will never give me up until I am married to
somebody else. He makes love like an angel,”
she added, with a stifled sigh. “I have had a
great many lovers, of course, but nobody that
I ever liked half as well as Lennox. But I
must not think of him; and as for seeing him&mdash;well,
if I did that, I should be on board the
Ariel before day. I will give my chance of a
cruise over to you, Aimée.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>“I only wish I could take it,” said Aimée,
with the most evident sincerity.</p>

<p>“Now we must go home,” said the other,
glancing out at the darkening water. “But
first come and let me show you exactly where
the boat will be to-night.”</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Twilight had given way to night, and
the sky was thickset with golden stars, when
the two girls reached the door of their boarding
house. A stream of light from the dining
room, and a clatter of knives and forks and
voices announced that supper was in progress,
so they turned at once into that apartment.</p>

<p>A party of about a dozen people&mdash;chiefly
feminine&mdash;were gathered round the table.
One of these, a handsome middle-aged lady,
looked up when the two entered.</p>

<p>“Why are you so late, Fanny?” she asked.
“You know that I do not like you to be out
after dark without an escort.”</p>

<p>“But it is so hard to get in <em>before</em> dark,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
mamma,” said Miss Berrien, taking her place at
the table. “It is lovely on the sea wall at twilight,
and the air&mdash;oh, what a feeling it gives
one! Do you suppose it can be ozone?&mdash;ozone
in the air, I mean? Well”&mdash;as nobody
appeared able to answer this question&mdash;“whatever
it is, it is wonderful in its effect. My
appetite is a most serious fact, and I am quite
ready to do justice to your good things, Mrs.
Shreve.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Shreve&mdash;an elderly faded widow, who
presided at the head of the table&mdash;smiled
faintly. The faintness of the smile was not
owing to any disapproval of her young boarder’s
appetite, but was due to the fact that, like
a good many other estimable people, she lived
persistently in the shadow rather than in the
sunshine of life.</p>

<p>“I like to see people with good appetites,
Miss Fanny,” she said in a tone which seemed
to imply that appetites were perhaps a slight
mitigation of the sadness of existence. “Try
the cup cakes; they are nice to-night.&mdash;Why,
Miss Aimée, <em>you</em> are not eating anything!”</p>

<p>“I am not hungry, Mrs. Shreve,” replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Aimée, who could not say that she was incapacitated
by excitement from eating, and who
looked with amazement at Fanny’s gastronomic
performances. How a girl on the eve
of a promised elopement, with a lover on his
way to meet her, could exhibit such a keen
appreciation of cup cakes and other delicacies
was quite beyond Aimée’s comprehension.</p>

<p>Her attention thus directed to the latter,
Mrs. Berrien glanced at her.</p>

<p>“What is the matter with you, Aimée?”
she asked. “Your eyes are shining as if you
had been listening to a ghost story.”</p>

<p>“She has been listening to a moral lecture,”
said Miss Fanny, giving Aimée an admonitory
touch under the table, “and she is
reflecting upon it.”</p>

<p>“Nothing is the matter with me, Aunt
Alice,” said Aimée. “I have no appetite&mdash;that
is all.”</p>

<p>“Want of appetite is very far from being
the trifling thing that most people consider
it,” said an elderly gentleman on the other side
of the table, who certainly himself had no
ground for complaint on that score. “There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
is no effect without a cause, and no physical
derangement which may not be attended with
the most serious results. If people would only
be warned in time&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I suppose nobody would ever die,” interposed
Fanny, a little flippantly; and then, feeling
that to talk of dying to a company chiefly
composed of invalids was not the extreme of
tact, she went on hastily: “O mamma! who
do you suppose I met at the hotel to-day?
Your old friend Mr. Denham, who is here for
his throat&mdash;that same throat of which he has
been talking ever since I can remember. I
also saw the English gentlemen who are going
soon on that hunting expedition which Mr.
Meredith thinks of joining, and which I should
like to join, too.”</p>

<p>“I have no doubt the party would be glad
to receive you as a recruit, Miss Berrien,” said
one of the ladies with a smile. “At least it is
easy to answer for one member of it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think I might count on his vote,”
returned Miss Berrien, composedly.</p>

<p>After tea this young lady retired for some
additions to her toilet, while Aimée&mdash;who felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
as if she lived, moved, and had her being in a
dream&mdash;went into the parlor and sat down
ostensibly to read. She was usually a great
bookworm, having been a devourer of all
kinds of literature from her earliest childhood,
and to-night she had a novel which at another
time would have absorbed all her attention.
But for once the letters danced before her eyes
and conveyed no meaning to her mind. The
romance of reality in which she was so soon to
play a part engrossed all her thoughts. How
would she acquit herself? What would she
be called upon to do? How could Fanny
possibly be so composed when <em>her</em> fate was
hanging in the balance? These questions
formed the burden of Aimée’s reflections, while
her head was bent and her dark eyes rested on
the open page of the book which she held.</p>

<p>Suddenly, however, she roused with a start,
for some one said, “How are you, this evening,
Mr. Meredith?” and looking up she saw
Miss Berrien’s lover number two crossing the
room.</p>

<p>A man with whom the world went well
and easily was Mr. Meredith, evidently.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Rather short, rather stout, rather rubicund, but
not ill-looking, and apparently not cast by
Nature for that villainous part which is assigned
in melodramas to the obnoxious suitor,
Aimée’s gaze followed him with a species of
fascination. This man, commonplace as he
appeared, was, unconsciously to himself, one of
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dramatis personæ</i> in the romance now proceeding.
“If he could know!” thought the
girl, with a thrill.</p>

<p>Exemplifying the proverb that ignorance
is sometimes bliss, Mr. Meredith sank easily
into a seat and began talking to one or two
people, without observing the solemn young
eyes regarding him from a shady corner. “If
he could know!” Aimée thought again when
Fanny entered, bright, sparkling, coquettish,
and gave him her hand as he came eagerly
forward to meet her. If there was a single
weight on Miss Berrien’s mind, a single cloud
on her spirit, no one could possibly have suspected
it; and Aimée began to wonder somewhat
if the whole thing was not a jest, when,
in the midst of the lively banter which with
Fanny generally did duty for conversation, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
sent a sudden, swift glance across the room,
which made the wondering girl understand
that it was reality after all.</p>

<p>The glance conveyed a warning, and fearing
lest she might unguardedly betray to Mrs.
Berrien’s quick observation that something
unusual was in the atmosphere, Aimée rose
and with her book in her hand went quietly
from the room. As her slender young figure
passed, two ladies near the door looked up
and nodded a kindly good-night.</p>

<p>“What a sweet girl that is!” said one of
them. “She seems the embodiment of gentleness.”</p>

<p>“She is so pretty, too,” said the other. “At
least, she promises to be pretty&mdash;and there is
so much mind and soul in her face!”</p>

<p>“Poor child! I fancy it is doubtful what
will become of her,” said the first speaker.
“Her father is dead, and her mother has married
again&mdash;married a certain Major Joscelyn,
who is very much gone to pieces in all respects.
I know the family well, and Mrs. Berrien
was talking to me about the Joscelyns&mdash;whom
she dislikes exceedingly&mdash;the other day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Aimée, you see, is her brother’s child, and for
that reason she has her with her at present. ‘I
found that the Joscelyns were simply making
her a drudge,’ she said, ‘and her health was
breaking down under it, so I decided to take
her for a time at least. Perhaps, when Fanny
is married, I may adopt her altogether.’”</p>

<p>“She can well afford to do so if Miss
Fanny establishes herself in life as well as
<em>that</em>,” responded the other, glancing significantly
across the room.</p>

<p>Aimée meanwhile&mdash;altogether unconscious
of being a subject of discussion&mdash;went to the
chamber which she shared with her cousin,
and, without striking a light, sat down by the
open window through which even at night
the air came with balmy softness. She felt
strangely puzzled, and strongly averse to the
service which she had pledged herself to perform;
yet the idea of retreating did not for a
moment occur to her. She had promised
Fanny, and she must perform whatever was
exacted from her in fulfillment of that promise.
But how much she shrank from this fulfillment
it is difficult to say. This impetuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
lover, whom Fanny herself was afraid to
face, what would he say, what would he do?
Would he rage with passion, or be overwhelmed
by despair? Aimée decided that
she would prefer passion to despair, for she
had a most tender heart, and the sight of distress
always unnerved her. She pictured to
herself the Ariel lying off the bar, with the
eager lover pacing her deck, sure that happiness
was within his grasp, fancying no doubt that
Fanny, like himself, was counting the hours to
their time of meeting; and then a picture of
the scene in the parlor below&mdash;of Fanny gay
and enchanting, of Mr. Meredith fascinated
and amused&mdash;rose before her mental vision.
“How can she?” the girl thought. “How
can she? To bring a man here just to disappoint
him! It is&mdash;yes, it is shameful!”</p>

<p>As she so sat and so thought, a clock
tolled out ten strokes. Soon thereafter the
different inmates of the house&mdash;being chiefly
of middle age and quiet habits&mdash;were to be
heard exchanging good-night salutations on
the staircase and in the hall, several doors
closed, and then Aimée heard her aunt’s footsteps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
approach her chamber. There was no
light, and the girl hoped it would pass on&mdash;for
she had the feeling of a conspirator, and
dreaded to be addressed by one whom she felt
as if she was betraying&mdash;but Mrs. Berrien
paused, opened the door and looked in.</p>

<p>“Are you asleep, Aimée?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Aunt Alice,” replied Aimée’s
voice from the window. “I am sitting here.”</p>

<p>“What! in the dark, and by an open
window! Are you trying to take cold? What
is the matter?”</p>

<p>“Nothing at all,” answered Aimée, conscious
that guilt was in every cadence of her
voice. “It is so warm that I did not think
I could take cold, and I&mdash;I like to look at
the stars.”</p>

<p>“Close the window at once and go to bed,”
said Mrs. Berrien. “You need not wait for
Fanny. She will probably not be up for some
time. Why are you so foolish and so peculiar,
my dear? It is better for you to stay
down-stairs in the evening.”</p>

<p>“I will hereafter, if you desire it,” replied
Aimée, lowering the window as she spoke.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
She was always docile to the least suggestion,
but at that moment she would have promised
obedience in anything, to atone for the deception
she was aiding to practice.</p>

<p>“Well, good-night,” said Mrs. Berrien.
“Have you matches at hand?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” answered the girl, glad not to
be obliged to show her face.</p>

<p>As her aunt went away, she threw herself
on the outside of her bed, and lay there almost
motionless, but wide awake for another
hour&mdash;the delightful hour for which Mr.
Meredith invariably waited, for in it he had
the society of his pretty ladylove to himself.
Fanny, however, who always sent him
away punctually on the stroke of eleven, was
to-night not remiss in doing so. Ten minutes
after that hour the door of the chamber
opened, and that young lady appeared,
bearing a light which flashed full in Aimée’s
face.</p>

<p>“Oh!” she cried, “how you startled me
with your great, solemn eyes! You foolish
child, have you not been asleep? I hoped
when you went away so early you would take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
a good sleep, and be fresh and ready for my
little errand.”</p>

<p>“I am ready,” answered Aimée, “but as for
having gone to sleep, how <em>could</em> I? It is all
too exciting!”</p>

<p>“One would think it was you who were
going to elope,” said Fanny, putting down her
lamp. “As for me, I am so tired of men, that if
it were not for mamma I would go into a convent,
where I would never hear of them again.
You can not fancy how Mr. Meredith has been
tormenting me, until I have half promised to
marry him just to get rid of him.”</p>

<p>“But you will not get rid of him if you
marry him,” said Aimée, with her eyes more
great and more solemn than ever.</p>

<p>“Simpleton!” returned Fanny. “Of course
not; but between promising and doing a thing
there is a very great difference, as poor Lennox
will find out to-night. Dear me!”&mdash;sitting
down meditatively on the side of Aimée’s
bed&mdash;“I wonder what made me such a fool
as to imagine for a moment that I would go
with him? The mere thought makes me
shudder&mdash;to be running off wildly and being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
seasick (the idea of my forgetting that I
always am seasick!) instead of going to bed
comfortably and getting up to-morrow to torment
Mr. Meredith by flirting with one of
those handsome Englishmen!”</p>

<p>“O Fanny, are you not ashamed!” said
Aimée. “To think what Mr. Kyrle must be
feeling at this moment, while you&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, really, I <em>am</em> ashamed!” said Fanny,
hastily. “It is abominable conduct, I know.
But you see I am shallow&mdash;shallow as that”&mdash;indicating
about a quarter the depth of her
little finger&mdash;“and I can’t help it if one nail
drives out another in my mind. I wonder
if it is my mind or my heart, by the by?
Well, anyway, in <em>me</em>. It is not my fault
that I am shallow; and, on the whole, I
think I rather like it. One has a much
easier life. Isn’t it a great deal wiser for
me to make the best of things as they are,
for instance, than to be distracted about Lennox
Kyrle, who I really like better than anybody
else in the world, if I let myself think
of him?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I don’t know,” said Aimée, who found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
this question too deep for her solving. “You
must decide, of course.”</p>

<p>“I <em>have</em> decided,” said Fanny. “Things
are best as they are. But now we must have
done with talking and proceed to action. In
the first place, I will tell you exactly what
you must say to Mr. Kyrle when you meet
him.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Aimée, beginning to shiver
at that anticipation.</p>

<p>“You are to say,” went on Fanny, “that I
feel it is impossible for me to take such a desperate
step as to elope with him; that it
would break mamma’s heart; and&mdash;and that it
would ruin his life, for I should only tie him
down to hopeless poverty. Say that I am
sorry, and blame myself dreadfully, that my
feelings will not permit me to see him, and
that&mdash;be sure to make this point emphatic!&mdash;he
must not dream of attempting to see me.
My resolution can not be changed. I am
sure I can trust you to put it all as well as
possible, Aimée&mdash;you have a great deal of
tact and judgment.”</p>

<p>“But why not write it?” demanded Aimée,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
whose dismay was not soothed by this compliment.</p>

<p>“My dear child, could he read a letter in
the dark?” asked the other, impatiently.
“Besides, I <em>never</em> write; I have learned too
much of the mischief that lurks in ink. Tell
him all this as quickly as you can&mdash;and be
sure to make it very positive about his not
trying to see me&mdash;and then run back to the
house as fast as possible. How lucky it is
that we live so near the water, else I could not
let you go!”</p>

<p>It is safe to say that, in this view of the
case, such lucky proximity was something for
which Aimée did not feel very grateful as she
rose to prepare for the expedition. Her courage
was sadly failing, not so much on account
of the lonely walk through the midnight
streets, as from the realization of the strange
and awkward position in which she would be
placed. She was trembling like a leaf from
nervousness and excitement as Miss Berrien
enveloped her in a large, dark cloak, and drew
the hood over her head.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Fanny, glancing at her watch,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
“it is time for you to go. I hate&mdash;oh, I hate
dreadfully to send you! If there were any
other way&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But there is none,” said Aimée, trying to
smile. “And I am not afraid.”</p>

<p>“It seems so cowardly to send you,” said
Fanny, half under her breath. “Yet I can not
trust my own resolution if I met Lennox!&mdash;and
then if it should be discovered&mdash;”</p>

<p>Her pause said more than many words.
At that moment the Meredith diamonds, and
all that the Meredith diamonds represented,
shone brightly before her eyes. To risk the
loss of them by keeping this midnight tryst,
was more than she could dare. And the girl
before her looked up with brave, generous
glance from under the dark hood.</p>

<p>“Don’t think of it, Fanny,” she said. “If
<em>you</em> were discovered, what would everybody
say? while if <em>I</em> am, it does not matter. Nobody
knows or cares about me! Come, now,
and let me out. You’ll wait downstairs to let
me in, will you not?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, I shall wait and count every
instant. For Heaven’s sake come back as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
quickly as you can! And be certain, very
certain, that it is Lennox Kyrle to whom you
speak. It would be awful if you gave the
message to any one but him!”</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>Being a little excited, and not at all
sleepy, it chanced that Mr. Meredith, after
parting with Miss Berrien, betook himself to
the sea wall, where he proceeded to pace to
and fro, smoking a cigar and wrapped in very
agreeable thought. Despite her coquetry,
Fanny had yielded to his suit more than ever
before, and he felt no doubt that in the end
she would yield altogether. He liked to be
played with in this manner. It was not
enough to discourage&mdash;Fanny was too wise
for that&mdash;but just enough to give a zest of uncertainty,
to sustain and keep alive the interest
which in similar affairs had more than once
failed him. In short, he was completely conscious
of being in love, and very much pleased
with the same, finding in it none of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
“pang, the agony, the doubt,” which are poetically
supposed to accompany the tender passion,
but only an agreeable stimulation. He
was even conscious of feeling distinctly sentimental,
and disposed to cast lingering glances
at Mrs. Shreve’s house whenever he came to
the spot where it entered into his range of
vision.</p>

<p>On one of these occasions he was surprised
by a sudden and very unexpected sight&mdash;the
opening of the street door and the emerging
thence of a figure. For an instant he had a
startled sensation; the next he said to himself,
“It is only a servant, of course.” But a moment
later he knew that it was not a servant.
How he knew it, is difficult to tell; but he
felt instinctively sure from the walk, the bearing,
and the motions. He stood still, a prey
to very odd sensations, and watched the approach
of the figure that had in every line a
familiar aspect. If it was not Fanny, who
could it be? He knew that all the other inmates
of the house were elderly people, except
Aimée, of whom he did not think at all.
But to conceive that it could be Fanny,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
alone and disguised in the streets at midnight,
was impossible. He said to himself that it
was impossible, yet his pulses were beating in
a most unaccountable manner, and there was a
sound in his ears like the rush of many waters.
It was natural that at this moment he did not
pause to ask himself whether or not it would
be honorable to act the part of a spy: he only
felt that he must know who it was that came
forth from Mrs. Shreve’s house at midnight,
with Fanny Berrien’s air and movement.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the shrouded figure walking so
swiftly, with head bent down, did not see him.
Poor Aimée’s pulses were beating tumultuously
like his own, and she was thinking of nothing
save her desire to accomplish her errand
and return to the shelter of the house she had
left. The night seemed to her invested with
terror, and the sound of her own light footsteps
on the quiet street brought her heart into
her throat. It is doubtful if she would have
noticed Mr. Meredith had he stood immediately
in her path; she certainly cast no glance
either to right or left, but hurried forward to
the place Fanny had designated, intent only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
upon one object, to deliver her message and
return.</p>

<p>As she mounted the sea wall she heard the
sound of oars, and when she paused, shrinking
and trembling on the steps that led down
to the water, she saw in the starlight the dark
outline of a boat containing two or three
figures. Her heart gave a wild bound and
then seemed to stand still&mdash;for was not this
the moment of fate; was not the impetuous
lover, who would take no denial, before her?</p>

<p>Certainly one of the figures sprang from
the boat as she appeared, and reached her side
with all the impetuosity conceivable in the
most desperate lover. Before she could speak
she found her hands in a close clasp, and a
voice was saying, in a tone of eagerness and
delight:</p>

<p>“So you have come; you are really here!”</p>

<p>Even at this moment it struck Aimée that
there was surprise as well as delight in the
voice. Evidently Mr. Kyrle had been by no
means sure that Miss Berrien would appear.
But the rapture of his greeting made it harder
for Aimée to explain that she was not the person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
so eagerly welcomed, and when she tried
to speak her voice failed. She could only gasp,
after a moment:</p>

<p>“I have come to tell you&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Never mind what,” interrupted the young
man eagerly, with probably a prudent fear of
what the communication might be. “You are
here; that is enough. There will be time to
tell me anything and everything when we are
afloat. Come, here is the boat.”</p>

<p>He drew her toward him, and so compelling
was his grasp that Aimée felt that in another
moment she might be in the boat and
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> for the West Indies. This gave her
the courage of desperation. She made a determined
effort to release herself as she said
more clearly:</p>

<p>“You are mistaken. I am not the person
you think. I have only come to tell you that
<em>she</em> can not come.”</p>

<p>“Not the person I think!” repeated the
young man. He released her hands and fell
back a step in his amazement. The violent
revulsion of feeling which he underwent was
evident in his voice, and the sharpness of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
disappointment so pierced Aimée’s heart that
she forgave the sharpness of his tone, as he
went on:</p>

<p>“Then who are you&mdash;and why are you
here?”</p>

<p>“I am Fanny’s cousin,” the girl replied,
then suddenly checked herself. “But you&mdash;who
are <em>you</em>?” she said. “I was told to ask
your name before I gave any message.”</p>

<p>“There is no doubt who I am,” he replied,
sternly. “My name is Lennox Kyrle. What
message have you for me?”</p>

<p>“Only that&mdash;that Fanny can not come,”
answered Aimée, tremulously. She paused and
clasped her hands nervously together, trying
to recall all that Fanny had impressed on her
mind to be delivered, but only the principal
points remained, and before she could gather
them into shape, as it were, Mr. Kyrle justified
his character for impetuosity by breaking in:</p>

<p>“That she can not come,” he repeated.
“Is that all, after having brought me here?
<em>Why</em> can not she come?”</p>

<p>The indignant emphasis of the last question
was, under the circumstances, natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
enough; and, confronted with it, Aimée felt
in every fiber the shame of the answer which
she was bound to give:</p>

<p>“Because she&mdash;has changed her mind,” she
said desperately, grasping the main fact and
forgetting all the fluent words with which
Fanny had clothed it. “She bade me tell you
that she is very sorry, but that she can not
elope with you and break her mother’s heart.”</p>

<p>“Her consideration for her mother is most
admirable,” said the young man with grim sarcasm.
“It is only a pity that it did not influence
her a little sooner. And so she is
‘sorry’ that she can not elope! She could say
no more for the calamity of missing a ball.”</p>

<p>“Fanny has not very deep feelings,” said
Aimée, in a voice of as sincere compunction
as if the feelings in question had been her
own, “but I think she <em>is</em> sorry.”</p>

<p>This simple statement, made in that sweet,
pathetic voice, said a great deal more than the
speaker intended to Lennox Kyrle. He was
silent for an instant, then spoke in a softer
tone:</p>

<p>“I know that she is easily influenced by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
those around her,” he said, “and so this might
have been anticipated. But if I were to see
her&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, that is impossible!” interrupted
Aimée, hastily. “She charged me to tell you
above all things not to attempt to see her.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said the young man. Keen disappointment
and mortification were in his tone,
but also something of comprehension. “Then
there is another lover,” he said.</p>

<p>Aimée did not reply. It was no part of
the message with which she was charged to
enlighten Mr. Kyrle with regard to the other
string to Miss Berrien’s bow; and since his
assertion was fortunately an assertion, not a
question, she suffered it to pass unanswered,
forgetting that silence, in this case as in many
others, was equivalent to assent.</p>

<p>“That accounts for everything,” said the
young man after a pause&mdash;in which, perhaps,
he had waited for contradiction&mdash;“and I only
regret that I should have given Miss Berrien
the pain which I am sure she must feel acutely
of treating me in this way. But it may relieve
her sorrow, perhaps, to know that it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the last opportunity she will ever have to inflict
a pang upon me. I have been the slave
of her caprice and my own folly long enough.
As I came here I resolved that this should
be the decisive test. If she cared for me, she
would go with me; if not, it was well to know
the truth and be no longer the plaything of a
coquette. Well, I am here, and she refuses
even to see me. She breaks her word and
throws me over without compunction. It is
the end. Tell her that from me.”</p>

<p>It flashed across Aimée’s mind, as he
spoke, that this was very much the ultimatum
which she had prophesied, but she had not
been prepared for the stern resolution of the
voice which uttered it. Plainly, Mr. Lennox
Kyrle meant all that he said, and Miss Berrien’s
comfortable belief that he would remain
her slave as much as ever was a delusion of
her own vanity.</p>

<p>“I will tell her,” the girl answered, in a
subdued tone. “I wish I had been able to&mdash;to
give you her message better. She said a
great deal&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Which I can easily imagine,” interposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Mr. Kyrle. “It is not necessary that you
should make an effort to remember it.”</p>

<p>Thus discouraged, Aimée felt that she need
no longer remain, that she had done all that
was required of her, and might now return
with speed to the shelter of the roof for which
she longed.</p>

<p>“I must go now,” she said, yet still she
hesitated. She longed to say a word of sympathy,
but it was not easy to do so. At
length, however, she summoned courage, and
spoke quickly:</p>

<p>“I am sorry, very sorry for you,” she said.
“It is dreadful to trust and&mdash;be deceived. I
would not have come on such an errand, only
it was necessary you should know, and Fanny
could not come.”</p>

<p>It is not too much to say that these words
brought her personal individuality for the first
time to the attention of the man before her.
Up to this time he had not given a thought
to the consideration of who or what she was.
To him she was simply the mouthpiece of and
means of communication with Fanny Berrien.
Now it suddenly occurred to him that here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
was a young, shrinking girl, who had come
alone at midnight to bring him the message
of the woman who had failed him.</p>

<p>“She could not come, but she could send
<em>you</em>,” he said, suddenly rousing to something
like indignation, “though I hear from your
voice that you are young, and this is no fitting
time or place for you. Do not let me
detain you longer&mdash;or, rather, let me take you
at once back to your home.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no!” cried Aimée, mindful of
Fanny’s promise to watch and wait for her,
and fearing an encounter of the two at Mrs.
Shreve’s respectable door. “You must not
think of it. I have only a short way to go,
and the streets are quiet.”</p>

<p>“Do you think I will force my way in to
her?” said the young man, scornfully. “I
assure you that I have not the least desire to
do so. What have I to say to her? Nothing,
except that I shall never trouble her again,
and <em>that</em> I can trust you to say for me.”</p>

<p>“I shall say it,” Aimée answered, feeling
not altogether disinclined to do so, “but I
beg you not to come with me. I shall be at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
home in a minute. Indeed, you <em>must not</em>
come.”</p>

<p>“I will not insist, then,” he said, hearing
in her tone how greatly she was disturbed.
“But you must go at once. This is a service
that only selfishness would have asked of you.”</p>

<p>“I came willingly,” said the girl. “It
might have compromised Fanny, but I am of
no importance&mdash;it can not harm <em>me</em>. I am
only sorry that I had to bring you such a painful
disappointment.”</p>

<p>“If a man is a fool, he must suffer, and deserves
to suffer,” said Mr. Kyrle, with a decision
that did credit to his common sense. “But
you are as kind as you are brave, and I shall
not forget you. Now, go.”</p>

<p>Aimée needed no second bidding. She
turned and hastened back in the direction of
Mrs. Shreve’s house and Mr. Meredith, who
had watched the meeting and conversation
from afar, divided the while between an overwhelming
desire to break in upon it and the
salutary fear of making himself ridiculous, had
the satisfaction of seeing the door open and
close upon her.</p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>“Oh, what a time you have been, Aimée!”
cried Miss Berrien as she opened the door. “I
have been in an agony! What kept you so
long?”</p>

<p>“Have I been long?” said Aimée. She
was almost breathless, and as she sank down
on the first seat at hand, pale and trembling
now that the need for exertion was past,
Fanny’s heart smote her for her words of reproach.</p>

<p>“Of course it has seemed long to me,” she
said, “but I do not suppose it really has been
long; and what does it matter about me in
comparison to you&mdash;you poor, brave child!
What a selfish wretch I was to send you!
You look perfectly overcome, and I have not
even a glass of wine to give you.”</p>

<p>“I <ins class="corr" id="tn40" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;“I dont want any wine,” changed to “I don’t want any wine,”">don’t</ins>
want any wine,” said Aimée. “After a while&mdash;when my heart
stops beating so dreadfully&mdash;I will tell you&mdash;all about
it.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Fanny, eagerly, “but at least
you can tell me this now&mdash;did you see him?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>Aimée nodded, being for the moment past
speech; and Miss Berrien at once locked the
door, as if she feared Mr. Kyrle might be on
the other side. Then she watched Aimée
anxiously, and when the latter presently
opened her lips as if to speak, interposed with
a warning whisper:</p>

<p>“No, no&mdash;not here. We must go upstairs.
Are you able to walk?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes&mdash;why not?” answered Aimée.
“I was out of breath when I came in; that
was all.”</p>

<p>“You looked as if you were about to
faint,” said Fanny, taking up her lamp. “How
thankful I am that it is over, and that you are
safely back!”</p>

<p>Aimée might have assured the speaker
that her thankfulness on this point was trifling
compared to her own, but the action of her
heart not being yet sufficiently regulated to
make speech easy, she silently followed Miss
Berrien’s stealthy footsteps upstairs.</p>

<p>Once safely in their own room, Fanny was
full of eager questioning.</p>

<p>“You saw him!” she exclaimed. “Did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
you give him my message? How did he take
it? What did he say?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I saw him,” replied Aimée. “He
was waiting, and at first could scarcely believe
that it was not you&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Poor fellow!” cried Fanny, in feeling
parenthesis.</p>

<p>“But when he understood that it was not
you, and that you meant to throw him over,”
proceeded Aimée, not without a sense of pleasure
in the recital, “he was very indignant, and
he told me to tell you that you would never
have another opportunity to treat him in such
a manner, and that he came here meaning this
to be the decisive test: that if you cared for
him you would come with him, and that if you
did not come he would never ask you again.
It was to-night or never.”</p>

<p>“‘To-night or never!’” repeated Miss
Berrien. For a moment she was too much
amazed to say anything more. Then her customary
easy philosophy reasserted itself. “He
must have been awfully angry,” she observed,
“and when a man is angry he will say anything.
But for his sake I am rather glad that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
he takes it in this way; he will not feel the
disappointment so much. I was afraid that
he would be desperate, and insist on seeing
me. It is a great deal better that he should
be furious, and talk about ‘to-night or never’&mdash;which,
of course, is all nonsense. It may be
never, indeed”&mdash;with a slight sigh&mdash;“but, if so,
it will not be <em>his</em> fault.”</p>

<p>“You would not think so if you had heard
him,” said Aimée. “Whether you marry Mr.
Meredith or not, I am sure that Mr. Kyrle
will never ask you to marry him again.”</p>

<p>“You do not know Mr. Kyrle as well as
I do, my dear,” said Fanny, complacently.
“He will be quite certain to ask me whenever
he has a chance. I only hope he may
not have a chance soon. I hope you told
him that he must go away at once?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Aimée, “I did not tell
him anything of the kind. In the first place,
you never told me to do so, and, in the second
place, I would not if you had. It was
bad enough to bring him here only to disappoint
him. You have no right to order him
to go away.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>“Upon my word, you seem to espouse
Mr. Kyrle’s cause very warmly!” said Fanny.
“Right or no right, I wish I had sent him
word to go away at once. It would be terrible
if he stopped here and met Mr. Meredith.”</p>

<p>“It would not surprise him,” said Aimée.
“As soon as I told him that you said he must
not attempt to see you, he exclaimed, ‘Then
there is another lover!’”</p>

<p>“Did he?” said Fanny, with a laugh.
“How like him! He always had that kind
of penetration. One might try to deceive him,
but he would go straight to the root of the
matter. But then, of course, jealousy helped
him in this case. He knows me well enough
to be sure that, if I had not somebody else,
I would not want him to go away.”</p>

<p>“So it is not <em>him</em>&mdash;it is just somebody&mdash;that
you want,” said Aimée, indignantly.</p>

<p>“Not exactly,” replied Fanny. “But you
are a child&mdash;you don’t understand.”</p>

<p>“I should be sorry to think that I would
ever understand such heartlessness,” said
Aimée.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>“Your sympathies must have been greatly
wrought upon by Lennox,” said Miss Berrien,
composedly. “It is not surprising; I know
how he can influence one. Ah, I shall never
have such another lover! You may think me
heartless, and, luckily for myself, I am not
very much troubled with my heart, but if I
chose to let myself go, I could be as desperate
about Lennox Kyrle as&mdash;as he is about
me. If his rich uncle would only die and
leave him a fortune&mdash;But there is no hope
of that.”</p>

<p>“If he has a rich uncle, why is there no
hope of his dying and leaving a fortune?”
asked Aimée.</p>

<p>“Oh, he will die some day&mdash;no fear about
<em>that</em>,” said Fanny, vindictively, “and he will
leave a fortune of a million or two. But
poor Lennox will not get it. That is all
hopelessly settled. The old wretch has made
his will in the most elaborate form, and left
his money to found some kind of an institute
that is to bear his name and have his statue.
It is all a miserable piece of vanity and self-glorification;
but he will be called a ‘public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
benefactor,’ and all that stuff, after ruining
Lennox’s life&mdash;and mine.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think he will ruin yours,” said
Aimée; “but poor Mr. Kyrle, what will he
do?”</p>

<p>Fanny shook her head in a way to intimate
that this gentleman’s prospects were
dark indeed.</p>

<p>“He might have done very well,” she said,
“but then, you see, he is impracticable, and
that is what would make it such madness to
marry him. His uncle told him frankly that
he had not the faintest intention of leaving
him a fortune, but that he would give him an
opportunity to make one for himself. ‘I’ll
give you a better start in life than <em>I</em> had,’ he
said, ‘and if you don’t take advantage of it,
that will be your fault.’ So he offered him a
place in his business house, which, of course,
meant the entire control and reversion of the
business; and would you believe that Lennox
declined the offer?”</p>

<p>“Why?” inquired Aimée, wisely refraining
from any expression of opinion.</p>

<p>“Because he has no liking for commercial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
life&mdash;as if that had anything to do with it!
He tried it for a while, then gave it up, saying
he could not waste the best years of his
life in work that he disliked. So he has gone
into literature, and is connected with a newspaper.
Conceive the difference! And fancy
<em>me</em> dragging through life as the wife of a
‘special correspondent’!”</p>

<p>“But he may be a famous author some
day,” said Aimée, with brightening eyes.</p>

<p>“He may&mdash;and again he may not,” responded
Fanny, dryly. “And even if he were
a famous author, it does not follow that he
would be anything save a poor man. Now,
I was not made to be the wife of a poor man;
any one can see that.”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;suppose not,” said Aimée, slowly.
These were mercenary ideas to be introduced
into the world of her young dreams of romance;
but she took them in as she had already
taken in the facts of faithlessness and
heartlessness, and no doubt assimilated them,
by some mental process, to such knowledge of
human nature and human life as she already
possessed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>“But now I think we have talked enough,”
said Fanny. “If you are not ready to go to
sleep, I am. I feel so light and comfortable
to think that I have safely disposed of the
Lennox difficulty! It has been a dreadful
weight on my mind ever since I received his
letter saying that he was coming. I was at
my wits’ end. I did not know what to do
until I thought of taking you into my confidence.
You have been a perfect jewel, Aimée.
I shall never forget the service you
have done me, and if ever I have a chance to
repay it in kind, I will.”</p>

<p>Aimée laughed. She had not a keen sense
of humor, but it occurred to her that Fanny
was about as likely to do for another what had
been done for her this night, as she&mdash;Aimée&mdash;was
likely to elope.</p>

<p>“I am sure that you will never be called
upon to repay it in kind,” she said. “I can not
imagine myself promising to elope; but if I
did promise, <em>I would go</em>!”</p>

<p>“I dare say,” replied Fanny. “You are romantic,
and you would enjoy&mdash;or you think
you would enjoy&mdash;dangers and difficulties.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
But as for me, I like the comforts of
life.”</p>

<p>Ten minutes later Aimée was listening to
the soft, regular breathing which told how the
speaker was enjoying one of the comforts of
life. It was incomprehensible to the girl who
was still tingling with excitement from head
to foot, and felt as if sleep would never visit
her eyelids; but her thoughts did not long
dwell on Fanny. They went back to the
lover, for whom her tender heart ached as she
pictured him returning alone to the yacht
which waited the coming bride in order to
spread its wings for the South. What a cruel
thing it was to let him come&mdash;only to disappoint
him! Indignation and pity were mingled
in her mind; and as hour after hour of the
silent night passed, she still lay wide awake,
her great, solemn eyes, as Fanny called them,
fixed on darkness, but her fancy seeing plainly
the starlit deck of the Ariel, where a figure
paced alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>


<div class="chapter"></div>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>Toward daylight, weariness overcame even
excited imagination, and Aimée fell asleep.
When she awoke it was from a dream in
which she fancied herself on board the Ariel,
and that Fanny had come to take her away.
“Aimée, Aimée!” said the familiar voice; and
when she woke, it was to find Fanny’s voice
indeed sounding in her ears, and Fanny’s eyes
anxiously gazing at her.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” she cried, rousing
herself at once. “Have I slept very late? Is
breakfast ready?”</p>

<p>“Breakfast is over long ago,” Fanny answered.
“I would not disturb you, for I
thought you had certainly earned the right to
sleep as late as you pleased; and fortunately
mamma never comes down to breakfast, you
know. But I have come to rouse you now,
because something dreadful has happened.
O Aimée, what do you think?&mdash;Mr. Meredith
saw you last night!”</p>

<p>“Mr. Meredith!” cried Aimée. She sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
up in bed, a picture of consternation. “It is
impossible!” she gasped. “I saw no one. He
could not have seen me.”</p>

<p>“There is no doubt about it,” said Fanny.
“He certainly saw you&mdash;saw you talking to
Lennox, and he thought it was me.”</p>

<p>“You?”</p>

<p>“Yes. And I could not make him believe
otherwise except by telling him that it
was you. Even then he seemed to doubt; so
I said I would bring you to tell him yourself.
O Aimée, it is mean beyond words to ask
such a thing of you; and yet there will be no
good in what you did last night, if you refuse
to do this!”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;I do not understand,” said Aimée.
“How will it make any difference? I went
for <em>you</em>.”</p>

<p>“But he does not know that,” said Fanny.
“He thinks&mdash;oh, my dear, you must forgive
me!&mdash;that you went for yourself.”</p>

<p>“You told him so?” said Aimée, in a
voice that did not sound like her own.</p>

<p>“How could I help it?” answered Fanny.
“He had been nursing his anger and jealousy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
all night, and when he came this morning I
hardly knew him. He was ready to leave me
at a word, and I should never have seen him
again. So what <em>could</em> I do but tell him that
the person he saw was you?”</p>

<p>“You could have told him the truth,” said
Aimée. “I am sure he ought to have been satisfied
to hear that you sent Mr. Kyrle away.”</p>

<p>Fanny shook her head. “You don’t know
men,” she said. “And I did not know Mr.
Meredith before this morning. He was so
angry, that I saw at once he would never forgive
me if he knew the truth; so there was
nothing to do but deny the whole thing. I
suppose it was cowardly; but I <em>am</em> a coward.
There is no doubt of that.”</p>

<p>Aimée agreed that there could be no doubt
of it; but the frankly admitted fact did not
make her own position better. As far as she
could understand, Fanny had boldly transferred
the whole matter&mdash;intended elopement,
broken promise, midnight tryst&mdash;to her shoulders,
and asked her to acknowledge it. She
could hardly realize all that was demanded
of her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you mean to say,” she asked, “that
you told Mr. Meredith that <em>I</em> had promised to
go away with Mr. Kyrle?”</p>

<p>“What else could I tell him?” replied Fanny,
desperately. “O Aimée, don’t you see:
what is the good of what was done last night,
if I acknowledge it this morning? I should
lose Mr. Meredith just as much as if I had
gone with Lennox. So I thought I might
trust you. I thought you would help me. It
is only to say it was you last night; the rest
will be understood.”</p>

<p>“The rest&mdash;that is, the falsehood!” cried
Aimée, indignantly. “O Fanny, how can you
ask it&mdash;how <em>can</em> you? I did not mind what
I did last night, though it was hard enough.
I would do that, or anything else of the kind,
over again. But this I can not, I will not,
do!”</p>

<p>“Then,” said Fanny, sitting down with a
gesture of despair, “there is simply no hope,
and I wish I had gone with Lennox. It is
useless for me to face Mr. Meredith again.
If I told him that you refused to come, he
would never believe that it was not me last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
night. Well,” with a long-drawn sigh, “I suppose
it serves me right. But I am sorry for
poor mamma.”</p>

<p>Sobs followed, while Aimée sat staring at
the wall before her. Fanny’s grief did not
touch her as much as it should have done,
perhaps, for she understood exactly the degree
and quality of the regard which that young
lady entertained for Mr. Meredith, and she did
not yet realize that disappointment over the
loss of possible diamonds might be as acute
as that over the loss of a lover. But the allusion
to Mrs. Berrien had more effect. Aimée
knew that her aunt’s heart was set upon Fanny’s
marrying Mr. Meredith, and for her aunt
Aimée felt that she was bound to do much&mdash;for
was she not the only person in the world
who had ever given a thought to her sad
girlhood, or attempted to throw a little sunshine
upon it? There was not much in
common between Mrs. Berrien and her niece;
but on the side of the latter there was a
deep sense of gratitude. “Should I hesitate
to do <em>anything</em> for Aunt Alice, who has
done so much for me?” she asked herself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
It was this she was thinking while Fanny
sobbed.</p>

<p>Presently she said abruptly, “Is Mr. Meredith
downstairs yet?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied Miss Berrien. “I
told him to wait for me, but he may have
gone. I hope he has. I can never face him
again.”</p>

<p>“I am sure,” said Aimée, tremulously, “if
you would only make up your mind to tell
him the truth&mdash;”</p>

<p>Fanny interrupted her by a petulant motion.
“Pray talk of something that you understand,”
she said. “If you will not help me,
of course I can not force you to do so, but
allow me to be the best judge of my own conduct.”</p>

<p>Poor Aimée! Her own eyes filled with
tears&mdash;tears far more genuine than Fanny’s.
How, after all, could she refuse this service
which was asked of her? It was hard, infinitely
harder than the one of the night before,
but it seemed to her that she was bound to do
it&mdash;to immolate herself and the truthfulness
which was one of the strongest instincts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
her nature&mdash;in order that her aunt’s desire
might be accomplished. With an effort she
said, at length:</p>

<p>“And if I were to do what you ask&mdash;if I
told Mr. Meredith that it was I last night&mdash;should
I have to tell him anything else?”</p>

<p>“No, no,” cried Fanny, with eyes sparkling
through her tears. “That is all. Leave the
rest to me. I don’t ask you to <em>say</em> a thing
which is untrue.”</p>

<p>“It is all the same if I let it be understood,”
said Aimée, dejectedly. “But I suppose
I must do it&mdash;if Mr. Meredith has not
gone.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t think he has gone,” said Fanny,
forgetting her contrary statement of a moment
back. “I told him that you had not
risen this morning because you were awake
nearly all night. So, if you will dress quickly,
he will not think we have been long.”</p>

<p>Thus animated, Aimée rose, dressed as
quickly as her trembling hands would permit,
and followed Fanny&mdash;who dried her tears with
wonderful celerity&mdash;down-stairs. When they
reached the parlor door Miss Berrien took her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
companion’s hand in an encouraging pressure.
“Don’t be afraid,” she whispered. “I will not
let him annoy you.”</p>

<p>At a more auspicious moment Aimée
might have resented this offer of protection
from the person who was dragging her into
the lion’s jaws; but she had no opportunity to
do so, for the next instant they were in Mr.
Meredith’s presence.</p>

<p>It had never occurred to Aimée before
that this was at all an awe-inspiring presence;
but now she felt herself trembling from head
to foot before the rotund, genial gentleman,
who looked unusually pale and grave, and
whom she was going to aid in deceiving. It
was this last consideration which made a
coward of her, and fastened her eyes to the
floor as she entered the room.</p>

<p>“Here is my cousin, Mr. Meredith,” said
Fanny, whose conscience did not apparently
make a coward of her. “She has kindly come
to satisfy you as to who it was that you saw
leave this house, go to the sea wall, and return
last night.”</p>

<p>Aimée lifted her glance and looked at Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Meredith then&mdash;who, in turn, looked at her.
More than ever her eyes were at this moment
the eyes of a startled fawn, and as they gazed
at him full of wistful appeal and fright and
pain, he said to himself that with such eyes deception
was not possible. He had thought
only of Fanny before, but now he felt a sudden
thrill of pity and compunction for this
girl whom his suspicions had placed in such a
position.</p>

<p>“I am very sorry,” he stammered. “I had
no desire to interfere in anything which did
not concern me; but I thought&mdash;I believed&mdash;It
was you, then, whom I saw last night?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it was I,” answered Aimée. She
spoke with a clear distinctness for which
Fanny blessed her, and met his steady gaze
unflinchingly. As long as it was the truth&mdash;so
she said to herself&mdash;she did not mind.</p>

<p>Mr. Meredith, on his part, was staggered
by her self-possession. Shrinking as she
looked, there was no faltering in her speech,
no shame in her manner. From her calm and
ready answer, it might have been the most
natural thing in the world for a young girl to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
leave her home at midnight to hold a tryst on
the sea wall.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” said the amazed man,
who began to think that a girl capable of this
coolness was capable of anything else&mdash;although
up to this time he had looked upon
her as an insignificant child, fit rather for dolls
than love affairs&mdash;“but it was so strange to
see a lady go out at such a time that&mdash;one
could not help drawing certain conclusions.
And the thought of <em>you</em> never occurred to me,
for I should have said you were much too
young for anything of the kind. And&mdash;by
Jove! you <em>are</em> too young!” he added, with
honest warmth. “Your aunt should be informed.&mdash;It
is not right,” addressing Fanny,
“that such an affair should be allowed to go
on.”</p>

<p>“I thought I told you that it was at an
end,” said that young lady, coolly. “Aimée
sent Mr. Kyrle away; and I promised her
that if she came down to satisfy your doubt,
she should not be annoyed further.”</p>

<p>“I have no desire to annoy her,” said Mr.
Meredith, “but she is so young that really&mdash;This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Mr. Kyrle can not be a man of honor, to
try to make such a child elope!”</p>

<p>“Aimée looks more of a child than she is,”
said Fanny, hurriedly; “and&mdash;and I have told
you that it is all over. Mr. Kyrle is gone.&mdash;And
now, Aimée, that you have satisfied Mr.
Meredith, I think you may be allowed to go
also.”</p>

<p>Perhaps it was something in her tone
which roused renewed suspicion in Mr. Meredith’s
breast. He looked from one to the
other; his brow lowered, and he said, stiffly:</p>

<p>“If you have no objection, I should like to
ask Miss”&mdash;he found he did not know her
name&mdash;“Miss Aimée a question or two.”</p>

<p>“You have no right to question her about
her own affairs,” said Fanny, who feared what
Aimée might reply to those questions. “I
promised that she should not be annoyed.&mdash;Come,
Aimée!”</p>

<p>But Aimée read rightly the lowering
cloud on the suitor’s brow and held her
ground, resisting Fanny’s attempt to draw her
away, and looking up with her clear glance
into the suspicious eyes bent on her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>“You think, perhaps,” she said, meeting
his suspicions boldly, “that I am saying this
to shield Fanny; that it was not I who
met Mr. Kyrle last night. But you are mistaken.
It was I. I will swear it, if you
like.”</p>

<p>“There is no need of that,” said Mr. Meredith,
still somewhat suspicious, but again disarmed
by those candid eyes. “I should be
satisfied by your word. Only, it is strange&mdash;”</p>

<p>He paused&mdash;for at that moment the door
opened, and a servant appeared, saying:</p>

<p>“If you please, Miss Berrien, Mr. Kyrle
asks to see you.”</p>


<div class="chapter"></div>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>Fanny’s courage was of good metal that it
did not fail altogether at this juncture. She
felt for a moment as if it must, and if Mr.
Kyrle had followed the servant into the room
it is certain that she would have thrown up
her game in despair. Thought is so quick that
even in the midst of her consternation there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
was a flash of keen regret that she had not
followed Aimée’s advice and told Mr. Meredith
the truth; but it was too late for candor
now. What would have been graceful confidence
an hour before, would now seem only
the desperate resource of exposure. She
looked at the door, fully expecting to see
Lennox’s face; but when she understood that
he would not enter without permission, her
courage rose to the difficulty and her ready wit
perceived a way of escape.</p>

<p>“It is <em>you</em> whom he wishes to see, Aimée,”
she said, addressing that terror-stricken young
person. “Go to him at once, and take him
into Mrs. Shreve’s sitting-room. You can
speak to him there quietly. But pray <em>make
him go away</em> as soon as possible. Remember,
mamma may be down any moment.”</p>

<p>She fairly pushed Aimée from the room
before the girl could utter a word or collect
her thoughts, and then turned with great self-possession
to Mr. Meredith.</p>

<p>“He is an impetuous young man, who will
not take ‘No’ when it has been said to him,”
she observed, “so it is best that Aimée should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
say it over again herself. He thinks, no doubt,
that I am influencing her.”</p>

<p>“You should influence her,” said Mr. Meredith.
“You should see that there is an end to
such folly at once.”</p>

<p>“I <em>have</em> influenced her,” said Fanny, very
truthfully. “But for me, she would not have
sent him away last night. And so you were
positive that it was <em>me</em> whom you saw!” she
went on, with absolutely mirthful eyes. “It is
true, Aimée is as tall as I am; but then she is
so slight, and so unformed&mdash;”</p>

<p>“How could I tell that at night?” said
Mr. Meredith. “And how could I think of
her? She always seemed to me a mere child.
I confess that I thought only of you&mdash;and a
most miserable night I spent in consequence,”
he added, feelingly.</p>

<p>“I am not at all sorry,” said Miss Berrien,
with uncompromising decision. “You had no
right to think such a thing for a moment, after
all that I have said to you. It was shameful!
It shows that you have no trust in me&mdash;no
real regard and respect for me. If I did what
was right, now that I have proved how you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
misjudged me, I should never speak to you
again!”</p>

<p>“Oh, you would not be so cruel as that, I
hope!” said the now humbled and alarmed
suitor. “Because, after all, I was hardly to
blame&mdash;I forgot all about your cousin’s existence;
and you know you have never <em>promised</em>
anything, so I had no right to feel certain of
you.”</p>

<p>“You will never have the right if you can
not trust me better than this,” said Fanny, perceiving
her advantage and pressing it ruthlessly.</p>

<p>It was not difficult to foresee the state of
subjection to which Mr. Meredith would soon
be reduced in order to make amends for the
mistake into which he had been betrayed.
Miss Berrien was determined upon two things:
first, to keep him well engaged until she was
sure that Lennox Kyrle had left the house,
and, secondly, to revenge herself for the fright
she had suffered; but despite her self-command,
her nerves were in a state of considerable
tension, and it is to be feared that it was
rather a bad quarter of an hour which he was
called upon to endure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>Not so bad, however, as that of poor
Aimée, who was sent forth to again encounter
and overcome the ill-used Mr. Kyrle. She
found him standing at the hall door&mdash;a slender,
handsome young man, whose refined face and
brilliant, eager eyes presented a type as widely
different from Mr. Meredith as it is possible to
conceive. He turned quickly at the sound of
her footstep, and Aimée felt as if the glance
which fell on her pierced to her trembling
soul. But there was nothing which she desired
or had need to conceal, so she came forward,
the movement of her slight, shrinking
figure reminding him of the night before, and
her dark eyes full of an unconscious appeal.</p>

<p>“I am sent,” she said, in a low, hesitating
voice, “to tell you&mdash;” And then she paused.
What had she been sent to tell him?</p>

<p>“To tell me that Miss Berrien is engaged
and declines to see me, I presume,” said Mr.
Kyrle, quietly, coming to her assistance. “I
anticipated some such message. But may I
ask why Miss Berrien has developed this sudden
fear of meeting me? She certainly can
not think that I will proceed to extremities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
and carry her off by force. It is possible that
she might have feared something of the kind
last night, but <em>now</em>&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, pray don’t say such things here!” interrupted
Aimée, finding her tongue in sheer
dismay, as she glanced in apprehension from
the staircase, down which her aunt might descend
at any moment, to the parlor door out
of which Mr. Meredith might issue. “Fanny
told me to take you into this room, where
we can speak quietly,” she went on quickly.
“Will you come for a moment?”</p>

<p>She opened, as she spoke, a door which
led into a small sitting-room. It was Mrs.
Shreve’s private domain, but Fanny (who was
her prime favorite) had obtained permission
to use it in emergencies like the present, and
when directing Aimée to go there she knew
that Mrs. Shreve was at this time out of the
house.</p>

<p>Mr. Kyrle hesitated an instant, then followed
Aimée into the room, and when she
had closed the door looked at her a little
curiously.</p>

<p>“Why do you let your cousin put such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
duty as this upon you?” he asked, abruptly.
“Why do you not decline to aid her selfishness
and duplicity? Then she would be forced
to come and face the truth herself.”</p>

<p>“I do not think it would do her any
good,” replied Aimée, simply, “and I am sure
it would not do you any at all. I have come
because she asked me&mdash;that is all. I do not
approve of the way she is acting”&mdash;with a
grave shake of the head&mdash;“but I could not refuse
to help her, for she is in a difficulty.”</p>

<p>“I can very well imagine what it is,” said
Mr. Kyrle, grimly, “and I assure you that I
have no desire to add to the embarrassment
of her position. I am simply here to end in
a definite manner what I have been foolish
enough to regard as a tie between us. I believe
I told you last night that I would make
no effort to see her, and had I followed my
inclination I should have adhered to that resolve.
But a little reflection showed me that
to leave our relations as she desired them to
be left was impossible on my part. It is
necessary”&mdash;he spoke with emphasis, drawing
together his straight, black brows in an unconscious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
frown&mdash;“that she shall clearly understand
that by her own act she has ended all
between us. I have a right to demand that
she will see me in order to hear this.”</p>

<p>“Of course you have a right,” agreed
Aimée, thinking the while how different this
was to the pleadings Fanny had anticipated;
“but just now it is <em>impossible</em> for her to see
you, so the best thing you can do is to go
away. I promise you that I will tell Fanny
whatever you wish.”</p>

<p>“I have no doubt of that,” he said. “Any
one who would undertake for another what
you have already undertaken in this matter
can be trusted, I am sure, to make a truthful
report. But there are some things which
should be said face to face; so I must beg
you again to request Miss Berrien to see me.
I will not detain her more than a few minutes.”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;” said Aimée, and then she paused,
asking herself what she could possibly urge
that would be likely to influence this very
determined young man, and save Fanny from
the Nemesis that seemed about to overtake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
her. The absolute self-forgetfulness of her
wistful gaze, as she stood with her hands
clasped tightly together, struck Kyrle in the
midst of his own preoccupation; but before
he could speak she went on hurriedly: “If it
were possible, Fanny would see you, I am
sure. But she is placed in a very trying position
just now, and she can not help herself&mdash;she
<em>can not</em> see you. If you would only believe
this and go away, perhaps some other
time&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I believe it because you say it,” answered
Kyrle, moved by a sudden impulse of compassion
for the distress on her face, “and for
your sake I will go. But there will be no
other time, so far as any attempt of mine to
see Miss Berrien is concerned. Her refusal
to receive me, coming after her conduct of
last night, makes it impossible that I shall
ever again approach her. May I ask you to
be my embassador, as you have been hers, and
tell her that I disregarded her wishes and attempted
to see her, not because I desired in
the least to change her resolution, but because
I wished to bring matters between us to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
positive and definite conclusion. I did not
want to leave any loophole for misunderstanding.
Be kind enough to make this clear.”</p>

<p>“I will,” said Aimée, in feverish haste to be
rid of him. “I promise you that I will make
it perfectly clear. And shall I tell her that
you are going away at once?”</p>

<p>“At once,” he replied, with decision. “She
need fear no further annoyance of any kind
from me; and you need not fear being sent
again on such an errand as that of last night.
At least there is no possibility of your being
sent to <em>me</em>, and I strongly advise you to decline
to serve Miss Berrien in that manner
again.”</p>

<p>“She is not likely to ask me to serve her
in that manner again,” said Aimée. “But
though it was not pleasant, I would rather do
that than&mdash;some other things,” she added, with
a keen recollection of the service she had
lately been called upon to render.</p>

<p>“It was simply unpardonable to have sent
you on such an errand,” said the young man,
his indignation growing with his interest in
the childlike creature. “What if you had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
been seen and recognized! She should have
known, if you did not, the grave risk you
ran.”</p>

<p>Aimée was too loyal to acknowledge that
she had been seen, so she only repeated her
former statement: “It would not have mattered.
I am of no importance at all; nobody
thinks of me.”</p>

<p>“Apparently not,” said Lennox Kyrle dryly.
To his credit it may be said that nothing had
so completely disillusioned him with regard to
Fanny Berrien, not even her perfidy toward
himself, as her selfishness toward her young
cousin. To take advantage of a child’s ignorance
and generosity, to put her into a position
that might have seriously compromised her,
seemed to him an act so unworthy, that he
could not entertain a shade of respect for the
woman who was capable of it. “But it does
not follow that, because nobody thinks of you,
nobody <em>should</em> think of you,” he went on with
energy. “You should think of yourself, and
not allow your cousin to make use of you in
this manner.”</p>

<p>“I am quite willing to be made use of, if I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
am not asked to do anything wrong,” said
Aimée, simply; “and it seemed to me that it
would have been worse in Fanny to go away
with you, than to send me to tell you that she
could not go.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps so,” said he, unable to resist smiling,
“and I am quite willing to acknowledge
that it was better she did not keep her appointment&mdash;better
to break faith than keep it
with an unwilling heart; but she might have
had courage enough to own the truth herself.”</p>

<p>“She was afraid of you,” said Aimée, candidly.
“And then there was the danger of
her being seen. If Mr. Meredith had seen
<em>her</em>&mdash;”</p>

<p>She stopped short&mdash;confusion and alarm
painted on her face&mdash;conscious how far her
tongue had betrayed her. There was an instant’s
hope that Lennox Kyrle would not
observe the name which had slipped out, but
the next moment proved that hope vain.</p>

<p>“It would have been awkward, certainly,
if Mr.&mdash;Meredith, did you say?&mdash;had seen
her,” he replied quietly. “But how if he had
seen <em>you</em>? Perhaps he did!” (with a sudden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
flash of comprehension). “I remember now
that after you left, as I stood watching to see
you safely home, I noticed a man on the sea
wall who seemed watching you also. If that
is the case, he shall understand the truth. I
will go to him myself.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no!” cried Aimée, in an agony
of apprehension. “You must not think of
such a thing! You would only do harm to
Fanny, and no good to me&mdash;for how does it
matter what Mr. Meredith thinks of me? I
am of no importance.”</p>

<p>“You have said that several times,” answered
Kyrle, “but I beg to differ with you.
Because you are a child now, it does not follow
that you will always be a child, and the
time must come when you will understand that
it is of great importance that you should not
be suspected of making midnight appointments
like that of last night. It was in a
measure my fault that you were sent on such
an errand, so I am bound in honor to let the
truth be known.”</p>

<p>“And ruin Fanny’s prospects?” said Aimée,
who felt that the situation was critical, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
something must be done at once to restrain
the impetuosity of this young man. It was
characteristic of her that the first idea which
occurred to her was of an appeal to his generosity.
“You can do that,” she went on,
fixing him with her dark, earnest eyes, “but
it will seem like a revenge&mdash;and a very mean
one. You will injure Fanny, you will make a
scandal that will almost kill my aunt, and you
will do me no good&mdash;for nobody knows anything
now except Mr. Meredith, and he cares
nothing about me. But if you go to him,
everybody will soon know something, though
not the truth.”</p>

<p>Lennox did not answer immediately. He
simply stared at her, so much was he struck
by her decision and good sense. It was true
what she said. By interfering he could do no
good, and it would certainly look like a revenge&mdash;“and
a very mean one.” Aimée had
instinctively struck the right key. While a
man of different nature might have stretched
out eager hands for any form of revenge, this
man drew back from the chance put into his
hand as if from a viper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>“You are right,” he said, after a moment.
“I should place myself in a false position by
interfering, and perhaps do more harm than
good. But, all the same, it is a shame that
the truth should not be known, and a greater
shame that your cousin should trade upon
your generosity. However, you will say that
is no affair of mine. It is true. And since I
can do no good to any one except by going
away, I will go without loss of time. Only
one thing more: besides my message, will you
deliver this into your cousin’s hand? I have
no longer the right to retain it&mdash;nor the inclination.”</p>

<p>He drew from his pocket as he spoke, and
gave to her, a small golden locket which contained,
Aimée afterward discovered, a picture
of Fanny and a curl of her sunny hair. As
she received it, a voice suddenly sounded in
the hall which brought dismay to her soul,
for it was the voice of Mrs. Shreve, and this
is what Mrs. Shreve was saying:</p>

<p>“Come in, if you please, sir. I will send
and let Mrs. Berrien and Miss Vincent know
that you are here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>“Miss Vincent!” said Aimée, in a frightened
whisper. “That is <em>me</em>&mdash;and nobody ever
comes to see me! Who can it be?”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mrs. Shreve’s voice went on
amiably: “You wish to see them in private?
Then step into my sitting-room, where you
will be altogether private, and&mdash;Oh! <em>Miss
Aimée!</em>”</p>

<p>It was a tableau for a moment&mdash;the open
door in which stood Mrs. Shreve, bonneted
and shawled; Aimée a picture of confusion,
with the locket in her hand; and Lennox
Kyrle, tall, straight, and handsome, standing
before her. The scene, to all appearances,
told a story evident to the dullest comprehension;
and it was not alone to Mrs.
Shreve’s eyes that it was revealed. Behind
her was a young man whose glance over her
shoulder took it all in.</p>

<p>The tableau lasted only a moment; for
Aimée, seeing the face over Mrs. Shreve’s
shoulder, uttered an exclamation of surprise,
in which pleasure evidently bore no part.
“Percy,” she cried, “is it you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is I,” answered the young man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
coming forward as Mrs. Shreve moved aside.
He cast a look of angry suspicion at Kyrle,
then, taking Aimée’s hand&mdash;which she made
no movement to offer&mdash;bent and kissed her
cheek: “You did not expect to see me,” he
said.</p>

<p>“No; why should I?” she answered,
blushing so furiously that it was evident his
salute was not a customary matter. “Why
have you come?”</p>

<p>“To see you&mdash;and to take you home,” he
answered, with another suspicious glance at
Kyrle.</p>

<p>This the latter returned with one of coldly
careless scrutiny, and then held out his hand
to Aimée.</p>

<p>“I will not intrude longer,” he said. “You
will wish me <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon voyage</i>? I am leaving St.
Augustine immediately.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” answered Aimée, eagerly. “I
wish you <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon voyage</i> with all my heart, and I
shall not forget&mdash;”</p>

<p>She paused abruptly&mdash;remembering that
she must not say, “I shall not forget to give
your message to Fanny”&mdash;and of course the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
sudden pause and blush which accompanied
it could bear but one interpretation to the
looker-on.</p>

<p>“I shall not forget your kindness,” said
Kyrle, conscious of the false position in which
she was placed, and angry at his inability to
right it. But, fearing to do harm and complicate
matters further by any attempt in that
direction, he felt that the best thing he could
do was to go. So with a parting bow he left
the room, hearing, as he went, an angry voice
saying:</p>

<p>“Who is that man, Aimée?&mdash;and what is
the meaning of this?”</p>


<div class="chapter"></div>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>VII.</h3>


<p>Aimée looked straightly and bravely into
the questioner’s face.</p>

<p>“That,” she said, quietly, “is Mr. Kyrle.
You do not know him, so we need not discuss
his visit. Tell me why you have come for
me. Is mamma ill?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered the young man, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
sufficiently good-looking countenance was very
much disfigured by the frown with which he
was regarding her; “she is very well, but it
is necessary that you should go home at
once. And I did not come a day too soon,
if <em>this</em> is how you are engaged.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by <em>this</em>?” asked
Aimée, indignantly&mdash;Mrs. Shreve having withdrawn
in search of Mrs. Berrien. “I do not
know why you should speak to me in such a
manner because you find a visitor&mdash;”</p>

<p>“A visitor!” interrupted the other, angrily.
“Do your visitors usually leave such cards as
that?”</p>

<p>He pointed, as he spoke, to the locket
which Aimée had forgotten that she still held
in her hand. She now thrust it hastily into
her pocket; but, though her face crimsoned,
she still regarded him with dauntless eyes.</p>

<p>“It is no affair of yours,” she said. “I am
not called upon to give you any explanation.
I am here under Aunt Alice’s care.”</p>

<p>“An admirable care it seems to be,” said
he, sarcastically. “It is fortunate that I have
come to take you out of her hands.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>“I can not understand why any one should
have thought it necessary to send you,” said
Aimée. “It is a new thing that what I do
should be considered of importance by any
one.”</p>

<p>Then there was a moment’s silence. It
was impossible for Mr. Percy Joscelyn&mdash;which
was this young gentleman’s name&mdash;to deny
that it was indeed a very new thing for Aimée’s
actions to be of importance in the opinion of
her family. Her repeated assertion that it
did not matter to any one what she did was
founded on most undeniable fact, or had been
a short time before. And if all was changed
now, if her actions had suddenly become of
very great importance, it was for a reason difficult
to state when thus confronted with what
yesterday had been the truth.</p>

<p>Fortunately, a diversion occurred at this
point which relieved him from the inconvenience
of answering her remark. The door
opened and Mrs. Berrien entered.</p>

<p>“Why, Percy, how do you do?” she said.
“This is a great surprise.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said young Joscelyn, as they shook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
hands, “I suppose so. But I have come for
Aimée.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” said Mrs. Berrien, looking as
much surprised as Aimée herself. “What is
the matter? Is her mother ill?”</p>

<p>“No, my stepmother is in very good
health,” was the reply. “But it is necessary
that Aimée should go home. There has
been&mdash;ahem!&mdash;a great change in her circumstances.”</p>

<p>“In her circumstances!” repeated Mrs.
Berrien, while Aimée’s eyes grew wide and
startled. “What has happened?”</p>

<p>“She has inherited a fortune,” said the
young man in tones of such solemnity as the
announcement warranted.</p>

<p>“<em>Aimée</em>&mdash;inherited a fortune!” cried Mrs.
Berrien. If he had announced that Aimée
had suddenly been transformed into a royal
princess it could hardly have seemed to her
more incredible. “You are surely mistaken.”</p>

<p>Percy Joscelyn smiled with an air of superior
knowledge. “In such matters there is not
much room for mistake,” he said. “You have
heard, I presume, of Henry Dunstan?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>“My brother’s half-brother&mdash;my stepmother’s
son by another marriage? Of course. But
he went to South America and died years
ago.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary, he died only last month;
and, having lost his wife and only child, he
made a will just before he died leaving his
fortune to the children of his half-brother,
Edward Vincent, of whom, as you know,
Aimée is the only child.”</p>

<p>“My dear Aimée, this is indeed a change
for you!” exclaimed Mrs. Berrien, turning and
embracing the startled girl with honest warmth.
“I am as pleased as if a fortune had been left
to myself. Now I need feel no more anxiety
about your future.”</p>

<p>“I shall never forget who was the only
person who ever did feel any,” said Aimée,
clinging to her as though some danger threatened.</p>

<p>Mrs. Berrien smiled. She knew that it was
true; that she had indeed been the only person
who had ever given a thought to the
future of the fatherless girl, and she was not
sorry that Aimée should recognize the fact.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
It was the reward for a good action, which she
deserved, because no such reward had seemed
even remotely possible when the action was
performed.</p>

<p>Naturally, however, this was not very pleasant
for the representative of the Joscelyns to
hear; and, being a young man with a considerable
drop of venom in his nature, Mr. Percy
Joscelyn felt impelled to reply to the implied
charge by bringing a countercharge.</p>

<p>“I am sorry that Aimée imagines you to
be the only person who felt any anxiety for
her future,” he said, stiffly. “But if I may
judge by the position in which I found her
when I arrived, it was at least not a troublesome
anxiety in the present.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Berrien looked at him with haughty
surprise. “May I inquire what you mean?”
she asked. “You have found her in exactly
the position she would have occupied as my
daughter.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” said he, with what Aimée inwardly
called “Percy’s disagreeable smile.”
“You are, of course, the best judge of that.
But I found her with a young man, evidently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
exchanging love-tokens. If that is a liberty
you would allow your daughter, I can only
say I am sure my stepmother would prefer an
anxiety that would take another form.”</p>

<p>Regarding him for a moment as if she
thought he had taken leave of his senses, Mrs.
Berrien then turned to Aimée:</p>

<p>“What is the meaning of this?” she asked,
“What is he talking about? There is nothing
that I can imagine more improbable than that
you were ‘with a young man exchanging love-tokens.’”</p>

<p>“I was not&mdash;O Aunt Alice, I was not!”
cried poor Aimée, divided between indignant
wrath and the desire to burst into tears.
“Percy did find a&mdash;young man here; but he
was only a&mdash;visitor.”</p>

<p>“But when have you taken to receiving
such visitors?” said Mrs. Berrien with amazement.
“And I was not even aware that you
knew any young men&mdash;O Aimée, this is indeed
a shock. I could not have believed it.
I should have said that you were one of the
last girls in the world to be guilty of such conduct.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have not been guilty of any conduct
to which you need object, Aunt Alice,” said
Aimée earnestly. “I would not deceive you&mdash;indeed,
I would not.”</p>

<p>“Then who was the visitor Percy found
with you?” asked Mrs. Berrien.</p>

<p>Aimée looked at her piteously without
speaking&mdash;for did not loyalty to Fanny seal
her lips? Had not Fanny been as anxious to
keep the knowledge of Lennox Kyrle’s visit
from her mother as from Mr. Meredith? The
girl was so absorbed in this thought that she
forgot how useless it was to attempt to conceal
a name which had been revealed to Percy
Joscelyn, and which he now hastened to
supply.</p>

<p>“Aimée seems to have forgotten the name
of her visitor,” he said, “but she informed me
that it was Kyrle.”</p>

<p>“Kyrle!” repeated Mrs. Berrien. The
truth flashed on her. She gave a searching
glance at Aimée, and read the whole story in
the girl’s beseeching eyes. She remembered
then that Mrs. Shreve had told her that Mr.
Meredith was in the parlor with Fanny.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
What could be plainer than that Fanny had
sent Aimée to ward off anything so undesirable
as the appearance of her old lover? But
with this knowledge came also the consciousness
of an unpleasant dilemma. To tell the
truth for Aimée’s justification would be to put
Fanny in the power of Percy Joscelyn, who
would take pleasure, Mrs. Berrien felt sure, in
injuring her by letting the truth be known.
Could she do this? Was such a sacrifice demanded
of her? The woman whose heart was
set upon her daughter’s brilliant marriage, yet
who was of an upright nature and had honestly
done her best for this orphan girl, knew an
instant of sharp struggle&mdash;and then Aimée
spoke:</p>

<p>“Yes, it was Mr. Kyrle, Aunt Alice,” she
said. “I hesitated to tell you, because I know
you do not like him. He was here only a few
minutes, and he is going away immediately.”
She paused for an instant, then added, “I do
not expect Percy to trust me, but <em>you</em> will, I
am sure.”</p>

<p>“Yes, my dear,” said Mrs. Berrien, with a
sense of mingled shame and relief. “I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
have to forget all that I have ever known of
you if I could not trust you. I am glad to
hear that Mr. Kyrle is going away. But
Percy”&mdash;looking at that young man&mdash;“may
be sure that the visit to you had no such significance
as he was quick to imagine.”</p>

<p>“I have not much imagination,” said Mr.
Joscelyn, “but I am quick to trust the evidence
of my eyes; and if Aimée will kindly
produce a locket which she put in her pocket
a minute ago, you may change your opinion
with regard to the significance of Mr. Kyrle’s
visit.”</p>

<p>“I can trust Aimée,” repeated Mrs. Berrien,
trembling lest Aimée should produce the
demanded locket, “and I will not attempt to
force her confidence. It is not to-day for the
first time that her actions have become of importance
to me,” she added with much stateliness
of manner, “and therefore I do not need
to be schooled in my duty toward her. Now
we will dismiss the subject. When do you
wish to take her away?”</p>

<p>“The sooner the better, I think,” replied
the young man with considerable spitefulness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
of emphasis. “There is, of course, much to be
done.”</p>

<p>“But Aimée is too young to do anything
with regard to business,” said Mrs. Berrien.</p>

<p>“Her mother is anxious to see her,” said
Mr. Joscelyn&mdash;a statement which made Mrs.
Berrien smile, and produced in Aimée a sense
of deepening amazement&mdash;“and it is necessary
that she should begin at once to prepare for
the position she will occupy.”</p>

<p>“What will that be?” asked Mrs. Berrien,
a little dryly. “Have you learned the amount
of her fortune?”</p>

<p>“Not precisely; but the letters received
from Rio speak of it as very large.”</p>

<p>“And so you are transformed into a South
American heiress, my dear little Aimée?” said
Mrs. Berrien, with a smile, putting her arm
caressingly around the girl, who answered, between
a laugh and a sob:</p>

<p>“I do not know what to think of myself
under such a transformation.”</p>

<h3>VIII.</h3>

<p>If Aimée did not know what to think
of herself under the transformation of her
changed fortunes, those around her knew very
well what to think. Never again would any
act of hers be reckoned of no importance by
the world, which, whatever shrines it may desert,
is always faithful to that of the golden
calf; and when Fanny Berrien learned that it
was a great heiress whom she had sent to keep
her rendezvous on the sea wall, and whose
name she had, in the minds of two people at
least, linked with that of Lennox Kyrle, she
stood aghast at the realization.</p>

<p>“For, of course, since Aimée is to be such
an important person, I have done her a great
injustice,” she confessed to her mother. “I
should never have sent her if I had not
thought her too insignificant for it to matter;
and the same consideration made me say what
I did to Mr. Meredith. How could it harm
Aimée, I thought! and now&mdash;”</p>

<p>A dramatic gesture concluded the sentence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
but did not lighten the cloud on Mrs.
Berrien’s brow. Indeed, Fanny said afterward
that she had never seen her mother so angry
as on this occasion.</p>

<p>“If the change of fortune had not occurred,
and Aimée had remained as insignificant
as you thought her, I should say that you
were guilty of shameful and inexcusable conduct,”
said Mrs. Berrien. “To send her&mdash;a
child under my care&mdash;on an errand that might
have compromised her even more than it has
done; and then to shield yourself by placing
her in a false position&mdash;I could not have believed
you capable of it! And the question
now is, what am I to do? I can not leave
Aimée under the imputation of having been
ready to elope with Lennox Kyrle.”</p>

<p>“I see no particular harm in the imputation,”
said Fanny, “especially since Mr. Meredith
is the only person who knows of it, and I
will see that <em>he</em> holds his tongue.”</p>

<p>“You forget that Percy Joscelyn found
Mr. Kyrle with Aimée.”</p>

<p>“And what then? He has only his suspicions
of some love affair between them&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
why should not Aimée be supposed to have a
love affair? <em>I</em> had half a dozen at her age.”</p>

<p>“Fanny, I am ashamed of you!” said her
mother, severely. “Is this a proper spirit in
which to look at a matter in which you have
been gravely and deeply at fault? Have you
no generosity, that you are willing to let your
young cousin bear the consequences of your
frivolity?”</p>

<p>“It is <em>her</em> generosity that makes her willing
to bear them,” said Fanny. “But if you
insist, mamma, I can set the matter straight, so
far as she is concerned, by telling Mr. Meredith
the truth. Of course, he will never speak
to me again, and I don’t clearly see how that
will do any good to Aimée. But still, if you
insist&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I suppose I ought to insist,” said Mrs.
Berrien, in a low tone. “It is a shame if I
do not. And yet&mdash;you have put me as well
as Aimée in a position for which I shall
never forgive you!” turning sharply to her
daughter&mdash;“you have made it almost impossible
for me to say what must be done. I
should like to see you married to Mr. Meredith,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
but I shall always feel that such a marriage
is bought too dearly if it can only be
bought by putting your young cousin in a
position which may throw a cloud over the
brilliant prospects of her life.”</p>

<p>“Mamma, if you will excuse me, that is all
nonsense!” said Fanny. “How can it possibly
throw a cloud over Aimée’s prospects&mdash;which
I heartily wish were mine!&mdash;that one
or two or three people believe her to have had
a youthful love affair with Lennox Kyrle?
Lennox is a very nice person&mdash;though you
would never believe it&mdash;and he may be a famous
man some day.”</p>

<p>“It is you who are talking nonsense,” said
Mrs. Berrien, curtly. “It is not necessary to
discuss Mr. Kyrle. Fortunately, he is a gentleman&mdash;there
is that much to be said for him;
otherwise we will put him aside. You say
that it can not injure Aimée’s prospects to be
supposed by two or three people to have had
a youthful love affair with him. In the first
place, what is known to two or three people
will certainly be known to many more; and,
in the second place, it <em>is</em> a great injury to any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
girl, in the opinion of people whose opinions
are worth consideration, to have had any such
affair, much less to be supposed to have been
on the verge of an elopement. As I have
said, it would be bad enough if Aimée had remained
insignificant; but <em>now</em>, with her prospects,
I can not endure it!”</p>

<p>“Then <em>my</em> prospects are at an end, and I
might as well bury myself at once!” cried
Fanny, who began to fear that her mother was
seriously in earnest. “It is not only that I
shall lose Mr. Meredith&mdash;for of course there
are as good fish in the sea as ever came out
of it&mdash;but I shall be hopelessly compromised,
and I can not even fall back upon Lennox
Kyrle, for he has gone off in a rage, swearing
that he is done with me forever. So you
might as well make up your mind, mamma,
that I shall be left on your hands.”</p>

<p>“Fanny, you distract me!” said her mother.
“Do you propose that I shall let this thing
go on, and suffer Aimée, who does not know
what she is doing, to start in life with this
story fastened upon her?”</p>

<p>“Aimée knows perfectly well what she is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
doing,” said Fanny, “and if she does not mind
why should you? As for her changed position,
when people have money they can do
exactly what they please, and the world never
dares to find fault. That is my experience.
But here she comes herself. Ask her what
she wishes. I promise to abide by her decision.”</p>

<p>It was indeed Aimée, who entered like an
angel of peace. She never looked more childlike
or gentle, yet her simplicity now as ever
was the simplicity of good sense, and as she
came forward she glanced appealingly from
the anxious daughter to the distracted mother.</p>

<p>“I was in the next room; I could not
help hearing, Aunt Alice,” she said. “I have
come to thank you for thinking so much of
me, and to beg you to let things be as they
are.”</p>

<p>“My dear child, it is generous of you to
desire it,” said Mrs. Berrien, “but I do not
feel that I have a right to accept such a sacrifice.
I must think of your future.”</p>

<p>“Have you not always thought of me?”
said the girl, coming forward and in her earnestness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
kneeling down by her aunt’s chair.
“<em>You</em> know, and <em>I</em> know, that nobody else has
thought of me at all. And will you not let
me repay you in the least for your kindness
and your thought? It is such a little thing
that I want you to let me do. Fanny is right.
What difference does it make whether two or
three people believe that I was going to elope
with Mr. Kyrle? It can not hurt <em>me</em>; but if
it were known of <em>her</em> it would hurt her very
much. I saw Mr. Meredith this morning, and
I am certain that he would never forgive her
if he learned the truth now. It is too late.
You can make things worse, Aunt Alice, but
you can not make them any better now.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Berrien gave a little gasp. It was
true, all that the simple, quiet voice said.
Things might easily be made worse, but it
was too late to make them better. She perceived
this, and was not sorry to perceive it,
even while despising herself for being convinced.
But what could she do, with Fanny’s
imploring eyes on one side, and on the other
Aimée’s resolution?</p>

<p>“I ought not to yield,” she said. “Whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
things were made better or worse, the truth
should be told.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; if the truth would do harm, instead
of good, why should you tell it <em>now</em>?”
said Aimée, with guileless casuistry. “I wanted
Fanny to tell Mr. Meredith at first, but she
would not, and now it is too late. You must
let things be, dear Aunt Alice. Promise me
that you will let them be.”</p>

<p>The insistent voice and eyes carried their
point. Mrs. Berrien hesitated a moment longer,
then meekly yielded.</p>

<p>“I am wrong, I know I am wrong,” she said,
“but I can not withstand you both. Aimée, I
shall never forgive myself if this throws any
shadow of trouble on your life. Remember,
if it ever does, and you wish the truth known,
call upon me and I will tell it.”</p>

<p>Aimée shook her head, smiling.</p>

<p>“I am not afraid that the occasion will
ever come,” she said. “I am too glad to be
able to do something for you, who have done
so much for me.”</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>IX.</h3>

<p>But Mrs. Berrien was not the only person
who felt concern about the very unjust suspicion
that might be cast upon Aimée. Lennox
Kyrle, as he went out, with Percy Joscelyn’s
angry question ringing in his ears, said to himself,
indignantly, that it was shameful that
such a misconception should be allowed for
a moment to exist, and that, if Fanny had
neither the courage nor sense of justice sufficient
to induce her to speak, it was his plain
duty to do so. Only one consideration deterred
him, and this was the consideration
Aimée had so artfully brought to bear, that
to reveal the truth would on his part appear
to be the revenge of a jilted man.</p>

<p>“My lips are sealed,” he thought, wrathfully,
“and Fanny Berrien knows it, so she
allows this child, who is too young and ignorant
to understand what she is doing, to bear
the consequences and the odium of her conduct.
It is infamous, and I will not submit to
it! Something must be done.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>But to declare in the warmth of righteous
indignation that something must be done, and
to decide what that something should be, were
unfortunately very different things. Mr. Kyrle
felt himself impotent in the face of the double
force of feminine resolution arrayed against
him, and yet he was determined that matters
should not be left as they were. The more he
thought of it, the more he was revolted by
Fanny Berrien’s selfishness and duplicity, and
the more eager he became that she should be
made to bear the burden of her own misdoing.
But how was this to be accomplished? He
walked away from Mrs. Shreve’s door after
asking himself the question, and finding no
answer short of that method which would be
open to the suspicion of being dictated by revenge.
One thing, however, he determined&mdash;that
he would not leave St. Augustine at once,
as he had declared his intention of doing.
That Fanny Berrien very much desired his departure,
was in his present mood an incentive
to remain. Yes, he would stay for a day at least,
and see if circumstances might not make it possible
for him to set matters in their true light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>At the hotel where he had taken up his
quarters&mdash;for this was before the era of palatial
hostelries in the quaint old Spanish town&mdash;he
saw Mr. Meredith and Percy Joscelyn, and
might have been amused by the glances, not of
love, which both men cast upon him, but for
the fact that he clearly understood the misconception
in the mind of each; and to be
held guilty of tempting a girl hardly out of
childhood to elopement, was as outraging to
his pride as to his sense of integrity. It is to
be regretted that he did not encounter Miss
Berrien at this period, for that lively and easy-going
young lady would assuredly have heard
some truths, clothed in caustic language, which
might have proved of benefit to her. But instead
of Miss Berrien, it was Aimée whom he
encountered again, in a manner most unexpected
to both. One of the girl’s greatest
pleasures during her stay in St. Augustine had
been to spend much of her time in an orange
grove on the outskirts of the town, to which
she had a right of entrance, as it belonged to
Mrs. Shreve’s son. Other people also went
there occasionally to walk under the picturesque<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
trees and pluck the golden fruit that
gleamed out of the glossy foliage; but Aimée
would take books or work with her, and spend
hours alone in what seemed to her an enchanted
world of soft sunshine, balmy air, and
sweet odors. It was therefore a place that
she felt she could not leave St. Augustine
without seeing again&mdash;the more especially
that, after the events of the morning and the
tremendous change that seemed impending
over her, she needed a little time for quiet
reflection. And quiet reflection in the house
with her aunt and Fanny was an impossible
thing.</p>

<p>So it came to pass that, in the last hour of
a perfect afternoon, Lennox Kyrle, who had
been taking a walk while chewing the cud
of unpleasant reflections, was attracted by the
appearance of a figure coming along the road
on which he was tramping. His sight was
remarkably keen, and after an instant, although
the person was still distant, he had no doubt
who it was.</p>

<p>“It is that little girl!” he said to himself.
“I call this good luck, for really the only thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
I can do, as far as I perceive, is to make
another appeal to her to tell the truth. Yet to
go back to that house to see her was impossible.
So it is surely a fortunate chance that
brings her here&mdash;and alone, too!”</p>

<p>The next moment he feared that he had
congratulated himself too soon. The figure
paused an instant and then disappeared. Had
she also recognized him, and desired to avoid
meeting him? He thought it likely, but determined
grimly that she should not succeed.
Since to reach Fanny and scorch her with
reproaches was impossible, his next best chance
was to work upon Aimée, and this he vowed to
himself that he would not be prevented from
doing. If she had gone into some house, he
would remain on the road until nightfall in
order to waylay her on her return home; but
if she had perhaps taken another road&mdash;The
suspicion of this made him quicken his steps,
so that a few minutes after Aimée’s disappearance
he reached the spot where he had seen
her last. No house was in sight, but it was
evident that she had entered a gate which led
into an orange grove, the beautiful alleys of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
which he had admired as he passed it on his
way out an hour before. Indeed, as he gazed
eagerly and quickly down the green vistas
filled with sunset light he perceived what he
sought&mdash;the graceful form pacing slowly along
one of the overarched ways.</p>

<p>To decide and to act was more a synonymous
thing with Lennox Kyrle than with
most men. He did not give a thought to any
question of intrusion or trespass. He opened
the gate and went in, striding quickly down
the path in which he perceived the slender,
girlish figure. He was not conscious at the
moment of bestowing much attention upon
the scene around him, but its aspect came
back to him so vividly afterward, that the sensitive
plate which we call memory must have
retained it with unusual fidelity. Long afterward
he could see distinctly the floods of level
sunlight slanting through the tree-trunks and
turning the very air to amber, the wealth of
glistening evergreen foliage, the boughs laden
with what seemed the golden apples of classic
fable, the indefinable charm of the Southern
atmosphere, and above all the delicate, childlike<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
presence like a vision of youth flitting
down the sunlit vista.</p>

<p>But if there was a satisfaction to him in
thus finding an opportunity to deliver the
thoughts which had turned so hotly within
him all day, there was not the least satisfaction
for poor Aimée, when, hearing a quick
tread advancing behind her, she turned to confront
the last person in the world whom she
had the least desire to see. She stood still,
clasping her hands instinctively together as she
uttered a low cry of dismay.</p>

<p>“O Mr. Kyrle!” she gasped. “I hoped&mdash;I
thought you had gone away.”</p>

<p>Little as Kyrle was in a mood for smiling,
he could not but smile at this ingenuous
address. “I am sorry to disappoint you,” he
said, “and to break my word&mdash;for I promised to
go, didn’t I? But there are reasons that seemed
to make it imperative for me to remain a little
longer. And, as it chanced just now, while
I was taking a walk, I saw you enter this
place, and I hoped you would pardon me if
I followed you.”</p>

<p>“But why?” inquired Aimée, far too disturbed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
to be polite. “Why should you want
to see me, and why&mdash;oh, <em>why</em> haven’t you
gone away? Fanny would be dreadfully worried
if she knew you were still here.”</p>

<p>“What Miss Berrien might think does not
trouble me in the least,” he replied, quietly;
“but I am sorry to annoy you. I really did
not think, however, that merely seeing me
would annoy you so much. Why should
it? I have no intention of harming any
one.”</p>

<p>“Without intention you may do great
harm,” she replied, quickly. “And I can not
understand why you should stay, when you
promised&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I will tell you why,” he said as she paused.
“But is there no place where we can sit down
for a few minutes? I will not detain you
long.”</p>

<p>She pointed to a bench not far off, a favorite
seat of her own, and one to which she
had been on her way when he overtook her.
“We can sit down there,” she said, with manifest
reluctance, “but I do not see the necessity&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>“Never mind seeing it,” he said. “Simply
oblige me&mdash;if I must put the matter on that
basis. I am sure you will admit that I have
been badly enough treated to merit a little
consideration.”</p>

<p>“You have certainly been <em>very</em> badly
treated,” said Aimée, her eyes softening with
sympathy at the memory of his wrongs. “I
hope you don’t think I forget it, or that I can
ever cease to blame Fanny; but&mdash;but making
things worse can not make them better. And
it seems to me that you can only make them
worse by staying here.”</p>

<p>“As far as Miss Berrien is concerned,” he
said, as they walked toward the bench and
seated themselves, “I assure you that I have
not the least desire to make them either worse
or better. It seems strange&mdash;does it not?”&mdash;he
broke off abruptly, “that this time yesterday
I was looking at the setting sun filled with
thoughts of her, and longings for the moment
that would bring us together, and that now
there is not a woman whom I know in the
world that I would not sooner entertain the
thought of marrying. It is a great change<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
to be wrought in twenty-four hours. And do
you know what has chiefly wrought it?”</p>

<p>“Her conduct, I suppose,” answered Aimée.
“It was bad enough to have wrought anything;
and yet,” she added, reflectively, “I
don’t really believe that Fanny herself thinks
it was very bad. She is&mdash;light, you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” assented Kyrle, dryly, “very light.
However, what she thinks is a matter of no
importance. And it is not her conduct to me
that has chiefly wrought the change of which
I speak, but her conduct to <em>you</em>.”</p>

<p>“To me?” said Aimée, looking up at him
with a startled expression. “Oh, pray, don’t
think of that. You don’t understand&mdash;Fanny
never meant to do me any harm. I was perfectly
willing to go last night, and it was not
her fault that Mr. Meredith, instead of going
home, as he should have done, stayed on the
sea wall and saw me.”</p>

<p>“Pardon me,” said Kyrle, “but I think it
was distinctly her fault. To have sent you on
such an errand was in itself absolutely inexcusable;
but afterward to let it be supposed that
you went of your own accord&mdash;that you were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
the person about to elope&mdash;there is no language
strong enough to characterize such cowardly
duplicity. You wonder why I am still
here? It is because I determined to see you,
and say to you that if you do not tell the
truth, I will. This shameful deception, this
trading on the generosity of a child, shall not
continue.”</p>

<p>Aimée looked up at him. When had she
seen any one so moved with indignation and
generous wrath? She thought again that this
man was far from the ductile wax Fanny Berrien
imagined him to be; but, righteous as his
resentment and anger were, it would not do to
allow him to act upon them. Yet how could
she hope to influence or bend the fiery resolution
that breathed in his look and words?</p>

<p>“It is too late,” she said at last. “I have
promised, and I have made others promise,
that things shall be left as they are, and nothing
would induce me to speak. Fanny is selfish
and thoughtless, but she never intended
deception. It all&mdash;came about because Mr.
Meredith frightened her, and she was afraid to
tell the truth. Fanny is a little of a coward,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
you know. She is very sorry&mdash;really sorry, I
assure you; but if she told Mr. Meredith now,
he would never forgive her.”</p>

<p>“And so you advise her to continue to deceive
a man whose affection for her should entitle
him at least to fair dealing?” said Kyrle,
bitterly. “Is a man, then, never certain of
truth from a woman? In Fanny Berrien I
am not surprised. But your eyes look as if you
ought to know what honor and honesty are.”</p>

<p>The eyes of which he spoke filled with tears.
No other reproach could have cut Aimée
so deeply. Twenty-four hours earlier she
would have said that honor and honesty were
the forces that would always rule her life; and
now&mdash;she could not deny that from this high
standard she had ignominiously fallen. And
how was it possible to explain what compelling
impulse of gratitude had made it seem
a duty to violate the strongest instincts implanted
in her nature? She looked at Kyrle
with the overbrimming crystal drops almost
ready to fall, and he, meeting the pained humility
of that look, felt as if he had struck a
helpless child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>“I suppose it was wrong to have helped
Fanny when it came to a question of deception,”
she said, “but you do not know how unkind
and ungrateful it would have seemed of
me to refuse. It looked such a little thing&mdash;just
to say that it was I whom Mr. Meredith
saw last night. And <em>that</em> was true. Oh, yes”
(quickly), “I know that it is as bad to imply
a falsehood as to tell it. But&mdash;but what could
I do? I owe so much to my aunt!”</p>

<p>“I have no right to hold you to account,”
said Kyrle. “Only let me ask if you think it
possible to owe any debt of gratitude great
enough to demand a sacrifice of integrity in
payment?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” she answered, simply. “I
am sorry if I have done anything very wrong,
but I will tell you why I felt compelled to
make almost any sacrifice to shield Fanny.”
She hesitated a moment. It seemed a difficult
subject to approach, and Kyrle was about to
beg her not to distress herself in order to give
him an explanation to which he had no claim,
when she went on hastily: “You see, I am
only partly an orphan. My father is dead, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
my mother is living and has married again.
She is very much under the influence of Major
Joscelyn&mdash;that is my stepfather&mdash;and I have
always felt, though perhaps I was wrong, that
she does not care much about me. The Joscelyns
have never liked me; so I was very unhappy
at home, when Aunt Alice came and
took me away. I can not tell you how different
life was to me when I went to live with
her and Fanny. They have both been so
kind and affectionate, they have done so much
for me, of whom no one else ever thought at
all, that there is not anything&mdash;not <em>anything</em>,”
repeated the passionate young voice, “that I
would not do for them. And I can not regret
what I have done, though I am sorry it seems
to you so wrong.”</p>

<p>“It is chiefly wrong to yourself,” said
Kyrle. “I wish I could make you see this as
I do. It is not less than a crime against your
future to allow people to suppose&mdash;for what
one person knows, many people are pretty
certain to know&mdash;that you were not only engaged
in a love affair, but on the point of
eloping with me last night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>A deep blush, beautiful in its tint but painful
in its intensity, spread over her face. She
looked away from him and her lip trembled.
He saw that some instinct which had been
dormant before was waking in her, and making
her understand the outrage which such a
misconception would do her childlike youth,
and he pressed his advantage remorselessly.</p>

<p>“You can not possibly comprehend what
injury the story might do your life at some
of its most critical moments,” he said; “but
your aunt, Mrs. Berrien, will comprehend, and
to her I shall go. I am deeply enough concerned
in the matter to have a right to demand
that the truth shall be told.”</p>

<p>“If you go to my aunt,” said Aimée, turning
upon him quickly, “you can distress her
very much, but you can not tell her anything
which she does not know. All that you have
said about possible injury to me <em>she</em> has said
and I had much trouble in persuading her to
let things be as they are. You must not think
any wrong of her. She knew nothing until
Percy Joscelyn, my stepbrother&mdash;who came
in, you remember, this morning&mdash;charged her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
with not having taken proper care of me, because
he found you in Mrs. Shreve’s sitting-room
with me. It was like his effrontery to
dare to speak so to her!” the girl interpolated,
with flashing eyes. “Yesterday no Joscelyn
of them all would have cared what became of
me; only Aunt Alice cared. But to-day, because
it seems they have learned that I am
rich, Percy ventures to insult her!”</p>

<p>Nothing could have surprised Kyrle more
than this sudden flash of indignant anger in
one who had seemed to him gentle to a fault.
But he was a man of quick perceptions, and
all the intense affectionateness, the passionate
gratitude and loyalty of the girl’s nature, were
revealed to him in that moment of emotion.
He was deeply touched and interested, for in
this instant he understood that it was no vulgar
love of intrigue, no lack of rectitude, no
obtuseness toward the finest things of life, that
had made Aimée play her part in Fanny Berrien’s
commonplace comedy of flirtation. Instead
of comedy it had become tragedy to the
girl, with her keen sense of honor, her high
standard of loyalty, and her delicate instinct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
of the claim which love and trust given create
in a generous mind. But there were motives,
deep-rooted in her nature, strong enough to
make her do violence to all these things and
stand firm as Fanny’s shield. Kyrle almost
forgot the point he was himself intent upon
in his interest in the springs of feeling and
action thus laid bare before him.</p>

<p>“And so,” Aimée went on, “when Aunt
Alice heard that you had been there she knew,
of course, what it meant, and she insisted on
hearing everything. Then she said the truth
must be told; that Mr. Meredith must know
why I went out last night; that now I am rich&mdash;why
are things so much more important
when people happen to be rich?&mdash;it would
not do for any one to imagine that I had been
going to elope. But Fanny said that Mr.
Meredith would never forgive her if he heard
the truth now, and I begged Aunt Alice on
my knees to let me do this little thing in return
for all she has done for me. So at last
she yielded, and I was very glad, and&mdash;and it
can not be that you will go to her and make
more trouble. Why should you concern yourself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
about me?” she demanded, turning to him
with another but somewhat lesser flash in her
eyes. “What is it to you if I do this?”</p>

<p>“Well, for one thing,” replied Kyrle, “I am
myself somewhat concerned in it, for I assure
you that I am not the kind of man to endeavor
to persuade a girl of your age to elope,
and naturally the imputation of having done
so is not very agreeable to me.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Aimée, with a look of contrition,
“I never thought of that. I forgot that
it could not be pleasant for you to be suspected
of such a thing. You must forgive
me for being so selfish; and yet”&mdash;she paused
an instant and gazed at him with a passion
of entreaty in her eyes, which at that moment
he thought were at once the most expressive
and the most beautiful he had ever seen&mdash;“and
yet,” she went on in a low, thrilling tone, “if
you could only be generous and kind enough
to allow it to be believed of you by the only
person who knows anything about it, I, for
one, should be grateful to you as long as I
live!”</p>

<p>But for the gravity of her appeal Kyrle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
could have laughed at the absurdity of the
situation; and yet her simplicity, her utter lack
of thought for herself, touched him again beyond
measure. “My dear child,” he said&mdash;for
in truth he did not recall her name&mdash;“I feel as
if I might do almost anything, simply because
you wished it; but you do not know what you
ask in this matter. You tell me that you
have become rich, which means important in
the world, and yet you desire to darken the
fair promise of your youth with such a story
as this would speedily become in the mouth
of gossip. It is impossible&mdash;it would be a
shame! I can not consent to it.”</p>

<p>“But what can you do?” she asked, dropping
appeal and regarding him now with nothing
less than defiance in her dark eyes. “Is it
not true that a gentleman is bound never to
betray a woman’s secret? How, then, can you
betray Fanny’s? As for me, I will never
speak.”</p>

<p>There was no doubt of that. A hundred
oaths could not have expressed resolution
more firmly, more immovably, than those simple
words. And what could Kyrle reply?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
He knew well that he could not betray Miss
Berrien’s secret, and it was the consciousness
of this that had made him so determined to
influence Aimée. But now he was forced to
own himself completely baffled. Aimée’s
strength of will was greater than any force he
could bring to bear against it, and there was
nothing left but to accept the situation created
for him as best he might.</p>

<p>“You are right,” he said at last. “A gentleman
is bound in honor to keep a woman’s
secret; so Miss Berrien is safe from me. If
she chooses to shelter herself behind you, and
you choose to allow her to do so, I have no
power to prevent it. But I am sorry that I
have failed completely to make you understand
what a great mistake you are committing.
To save an unprincipled flirt from the
consequences of her double-dealing, you are
laying a cloud on your own life at its beginning.”</p>

<p>“I care nothing about that,” said the girl,
with honest indifference. “I am only sorry
that Mr. Meredith should be deceived, and
that you have to bear (though only in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
opinion) that imputation of which you spoke
a few minutes ago. But I am going away
to-morrow; and since it seems I am of some
importance now” (a sigh), “I suppose the
Joscelyns will keep me always; so he and
everybody else will soon forget all about this.”</p>

<p>“I assure you that I shall never forget it,”
said Kyrle. “It is an episode calculated to
remain in a man’s memory. The heartless,
selfish woman who has made a fool of me, I
shall indeed have no trouble in forgetting;
but the part you have played, mistaken as it
is, I shall long remember. I only wish you
had displayed such qualities as you have
proved yourself to possess, in a better cause.
Given a good cause, you would be a heroine.
And now”&mdash;he rose as he spoke&mdash;“this time
it is good-by. Since I have failed completely
in the end for which I remained here, I shall
return at once to the yacht. Will you shake
hands with me and tell me your name? One
should surely know as much as that of a
young lady with whom he is supposed to
have nearly eloped.”</p>

<p>But Aimée could not jest on such a subject.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
She gravely told him her name and put
out her hand. For long he carried with him
a picture of the slender presence, the delicate
face looking wistfully into his, as if to make
sure that this time he could be relied upon
to depart, and the golden sunset glory seen
through the orange boughs behind her.</p>

<p>“Good-by,” he said, gently. “I am sorry I
have not moved you. Some day you will see
that I am right, and I only hope you will not
then too much regret that you did not follow
my advice.”</p>

<p>He pressed her hand warmly, released it,
and walked away, down the green vista of the
grove.</p>

<h2 class="p4 no-brk">PART II.</h2>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>It is an April day, and Venice is lying
under a brilliant sun, which brings out all the
beryl sheen of its translucent waterways, the
gleam of its marvelous domes, the Byzantine
color that still clings to the front of its palaces,
and all the life of its picturesque and varied
humanity. It is the last which specially appeals
to the interest of a man who has strolled
from the Piazza San Marco into the Piazzetta,
and watches the animated movement along
the Riva de’ Schiavoni, that meeting-place of
Italy and the Orient, with eyes that take in
every variety of the types passing before him.
And when they grow tired of water-carriers and
gondoliers, of soldiers and sailors, of Italians,
Greeks, Austrians, and Orientals, they have but
to look beyond on the fairest scene in the
world&mdash;the wide, green plain of shining water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
as the Grand Canal opens into the lagoon,
the isle of San Giorgio with its cluster of picturesque
buildings, and far to seaward the Armenian
Convent of San Lazare.</p>

<p>But the picture grows too dazzling after a
while, and the observer, turning, walks toward
the palace of the Doges, entered under the
Saracenic arches into its great court, and ascending
the Giant’s Stairway passed into those
gorgeous saloons where the sumptuous life of
old Venice still glows on the walls in that
Venetian art which in glory of coloring excels
every other school. The usual number of
tourists, with open guide-books, were scattered
through the apartments, filling even the dread
chamber of the Council of Ten with their light
chatter; but the newcomer avoided them, lingered
only in comparatively empty rooms, and
presently wandered into the Hall of the
Great Council, whence he passed out of an
empty window to a balcony, where he found
himself on a level with the top of the column
which bears the winged lion, and overlooking
from this higher elevation the same wide,
beautiful picture of sea and sky, of glittering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
domes and sun-tinted campanili, which he had
lately seen from below.</p>

<p>On a seat conveniently placed in a corner
of the balcony he sat down, and with his back
against the stone wall of the Ducal Palace,
with the famous lion smiling familiarly upon
him, and with the scene of all the past glory
and triumphs of Venice before his eyes, he
fell easily into that waking dream which
Venice above all places has power to produce.
For where else is the setting of the past so
perfectly preserved? From the gorgeous
frescoes of Tintoretto and Paul Veronese, one
steps forth to look on the unchanged scene&mdash;palaces,
columns, quays, luminous sea, and
dazzling sky&mdash;of the great events they represent,
and to ask one’s self if the stately pageants
will not soon come forth to meet the victorious
galleys laden with the spoils of the East,
or to accompany the Doge when he goes forth
in state to wed the Adriatic?</p>

<p>Into some such dream this man had fallen,
when his pleasant solitude suffered an interruption.
Through the open window a figure
suddenly stepped, and advancing to the balustrade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
stood before him outlined against the
horizon of sea and sky. For a moment he
was inclined to regard with impatience this
new object, obtruded into the foreground of
the picture he had been contemplating with so
much satisfaction; then it dawned upon him
that, so far from marring, it rather added a
new and charming element to this picture.
For it was the figure of a young girl, tall and
graceful, with an indescribable beauty in the
carriage of the small, shapely head and the
lines of the neck and shoulders. Her attitude,
too, was full of unconscious grace, as she stood
gazing seaward; and since her back was
turned toward him, he could admire this grace
at his leisure, together with the picturesque
drapery of her dress, which was made of some
fabric as soft and clinging in quality as it was
harmonious in color.</p>

<p>But presently she turned her face toward
the great lion of St. Mark, and presented to his
view what he instantly decided to be the loveliest
profile he had ever seen&mdash;a profile as clearly
cut as that of a head on an antique cameo, but
with a peculiarly delicate grace of its own, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
with coloring as exquisite as the tints of a
flower. She was smiling as she looked at the
lion&mdash;who stonily regarded her from his pedestal&mdash;and
she made such a delightful picture in
her youth and beauty, that the man behind her
held his breath, fearing lest some chance movement
should betray his presence and cause her
to disappear.</p>

<p>But, instead of this, she was presently
joined by another figure, that of a young man,
who stepped through the window and walked
up to her side with an air of easy familiarity.</p>

<p>“By Jove!” said the newcomer, “I don’t
wonder that you come out here for relief from
those miles of pictures! Their effect is positively
stupefying.”</p>

<p>“To <em>you</em>, perhaps, it may be,” said the
young lady, in a very sweet voice, with a
slightly mocking accent. “But it was not because
<em>I</em> felt stupefied that I came out, but because
the greater picture tempted me. When
one has Venice before one’s eyes, one hardly
cares to look at paintings.”</p>

<p>“That is exactly my opinion,” said the
young man, “so let us go down and get into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
a gondola and float about. That is the principal
thing to do, besides lounging in the
piazza.”</p>

<p>“Then suppose you go and lounge in the
piazza,” said the young lady. “I am very well
satisfied where I am,” and as she spoke she
turned again toward the railing, with the air
of one who did not mean to stir.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am very well satisfied to stay here&mdash;with
you,” said her companion, leaning beside
her.</p>

<p>At this point it occurred to the unobserved
listener behind that the time had
come for him to retire. Solitude was charming,
and charming also was the contemplation
of a single graceful figure in the foreground
of a noble picture; but a conventional
pair of young people engaged in a
conventional flirtation was more than he could
endure. With a sense of disgust and vexation
he rose, and entered again the Hall of
Council.</p>

<p>Over this magnificent apartment various
groups were scattered, some studying the frescoes
of battles and triumphs, others following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
the frieze of Doges’ portraits, and pausing before
the vacant panel across which is thrown
a black curtain and on which is painted the
name of Marino Faliero, and the short sentence,
“<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Decapitati pro criminibus</i>,” while others
were occupied with Tintoretto’s vast <cite>Paradiso</cite>.
Among the latter was a pretty, fashionably
dressed young woman, who, seated on a chair
before the immense picture, had transferred
her attention from it to the costumes of a pair
of English girls, whose dresses were as ill-fitting
as their complexions were blooming, and
who appeared to be studying the great composition
in detail, unconscious of the critical
glances of the animated fashion-plate behind
them.</p>

<p>This little scene attracted the notice of the
idler from the balcony, and as he advanced,
drawn rather by amusement than by any special
interest on his own part in the <cite>Paradiso</cite>,
the lady of the chair turned her eyeglass upon
him. A moment later she had dropped it and
risen to her feet, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“What, Lennox&mdash;Mr. Kyrle!”</p>

<p>Lennox Kyrle&mdash;for it was he&mdash;started and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
looked at her for an instant; then he held
out his hand, saying, quietly:</p>

<p>“This is a very unexpected pleasure, Mrs.
Meredith.”</p>

<p>Fanny Meredith turned from white to
red, and red to white again. His composure
seemed to rebuke her agitation and that slip
of the tongue&mdash;“Lennox.” Moreover, she
could not forget that this was the first time
they had met since parting as lovers. But
she recovered herself quickly, and, glancing up
as she gave him her hand, said, a little reproachfully:</p>

<p>“I knew you at once, though you have
changed, but you were not sure of me.”</p>

<p>“Yet you have <em>not</em> changed,” said he,
smiling and wondering&mdash;so quick is thought!&mdash;as
he looked into her upturned face, where
he had found the charm which once enslaved
him. She had not changed, he was quite
right about that; but where was there inspiration
for any of the rapture and agony of passion
in this blooming, piquant, commonplace
countenance? As he held the hand which he
had once so eagerly coveted, he thanked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
Heaven for that old disappointment, while he
said, “But I could not expect to meet you
here.”</p>

<p>“As easily as I could expect to meet you,”
she answered, “though it is true I heard that
you had gone to Egypt as a war correspondent.
But the war has been over for some
time.”</p>

<p>“For something like half a year,” he replied;
“but I have been up the Nile, and,
had it not been for a sudden summons calling
me home, I might be emulating Stanley
in equatorial Africa now.”</p>

<p>“I should think you would rather be here,”
said Mrs. Meredith, with a little shudder.
“We have lately come, and I am delighted
with Venice.”</p>

<p>“Most people are,” said Lennox; “and by
‘we’ you mean, I presume, Mr. Meredith and
yourself?”</p>

<p>“And the Joscelyns. We joined them
in Paris. You know the Joscelyns? No?
Well, at least”&mdash;with a sudden laugh and
blush&mdash;“you remember Aimée?”</p>

<p>“Aimée!” he repeated, in a puzzled tone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
Then suddenly there flashed upon him the
memory of the old sea wall of St. Augustine,
of the tide murmuring at his feet, of the stars
shining overhead, and of a sweet, frightened
voice saying, “I am sent to tell you that
Fanny can not come.” The name, which he
had forgotten, brought the scene back like a
picture, and with it also another scene&mdash;an
orange grove at sunset, its alleys filled with
golden light, its glistening foliage meeting like
an arcade above, and a pair of dark eyes gazing
half-beseechingly, half-defiantly into his,
while the same sweet voice said, “As for me, I
will never speak!” Remember her! How
could he ever forget the delicate, childlike
creature, with her unbending loyalty? His
eyes, which time had not rendered less brilliant
and keen, gave a flash of recollection as
he turned them on Mrs. Meredith, saying,
“You mean the young cousin whom you
sent&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she interrupted, looking around
with a quick glance. “Pray, be more cautious.
If it were suspected, there would
be trouble even yet. It is a great bore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
to have a jealous husband! And you know
you are supposed to have been Aimée’s
lover.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kyrle drew his brows together, and
lifted a head which was not without natural
haughtiness a little higher. He thought that
the bad taste of this speech was only equaled
by its impertinence.</p>

<p>“I am aware,” he said, stiffly, “of the deception
which you induced your cousin to assist
you in practicing at the time of which you
speak; but I hardly thought it possible that
even you could have allowed such an impression
to remain until now.”</p>

<p>“You are as flattering as ever, I perceive,”
said Fanny, coolly. “‘Even you’&mdash;that means,
I suppose, that you consider me bad enough
for anything, and yet are a little surprised that
I have been bad enough for this! But, you
see, if it was a matter of necessity at the time,
it has been equally a matter of necessity ever
since. And it did Aimée no harm; whereas
to have told the truth, then or later, would
have done <em>me</em> great harm.”</p>

<p>“I remember that she described herself as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
of no importance,” said Kyrle, “and it seems
that you fully shared the opinion.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Fanny, calmly, “that was
what we both thought, she and I, when I sent
her on that unlucky errand. I shall never forgive
Mr. Meredith for not going home and to
bed like a Christian that night! But, as it
turned out, she was really a person of much
importance. She inherited a great South
American fortune, and she is now an heiress
and beauty of the first rank.”</p>

<p>“And yet,” cried Kyrle, with the old indignation
rushing over him, “you have suffered
her to rest under&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The aspersion of having been on the
point of eloping with you,” said Fanny, with a
subdued, wicked laugh. “Yes, it was a necessity
of the situation, and I will say for Aimée
that she is the most generous creature I ever
knew. I really can not see why you should
look so indignant. Pray, do you think it such
a horrible thing to have been on the point
of eloping with you?”</p>

<p>“I think,” he answered, haughtily, “that it
is a shameful injustice to allow a young girl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
to rest under the imputation of having been
about to elope with any one when she is altogether
innocent of it.”</p>

<p>“We went over all that and settled it at
the time,” said Mrs. Meredith, impatiently,
“and it is much too late to unsettle it now. It
is ancient history&mdash;dead, buried, forgotten.
Besides, no one knows anything about it except
Mr. Meredith; and there is surely not
much to harm Aimée in one person’s knowledge.
Percy Joscelyn suspects something&mdash;you
may remember that he found you with
Aimée on that awfully unlucky day&mdash;but he
does not <em>know</em> anything. He will, however,
look upon you as having been her lover, and
the whole Joscelyn clan will be thrown into
consternation by your appearance. They
watch the poor child, and every man who approaches
her, like so many dragons. How
amusing”&mdash;with another irrepressible laugh&mdash;“it
is that you should have turned up just
now!”</p>

<p>“At the cost of depriving you of some
amusement,” he said, coldly, “I shall not renew
my acquaintance with your cousin&mdash;if acquaintance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
it could be called. The last thing
I am capable of is of annoying one who has
already been the victim of such an injustice.”</p>

<p>“But why should you annoy her?” inquired
Fanny&mdash;whom time had evidently not
robbed of any of her volatile qualities&mdash;opening
her eyes. “And you don’t know, really,
what you will lose. She is charming! Every
one admires her immensely.”</p>

<p>“I shall not have the opportunity of doing
so,” replied Kyrle, more stiffly than ever,
for he said to himself that this woman was insufferable.
“I am leaving Venice almost immediately,
and since I may not have the pleasure
of seeing you again, I shall therefore bid
you adieu&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Not just yet,” said Fanny, with a note of
malicious triumph in her voice. “Here is an
old friend to whom you must speak first.&mdash;Aimée,
my dear, let me recall Mr. Kyrle to
your recollection.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Kyrle turned, full of anger, which changed
in a moment by some miraculous process into
satisfaction, for who should stand before him,
with wondering eyes and faintly flushing
cheeks, but the lovely lady of the balcony!</p>

<p>And she was lovelier even than he had
imagined, with a face in which all fine issues
of thought and feeling seemed to meet. She
looked surprised, yet the gentle, curving lips
smiled as it were irresistibly, while she said,
with the composure of a woman of the world,
“I recollect Mr. Kyrle perfectly, though I
should not have known him.”</p>

<p>“Nor I you,” Lennox answered, bowing
deeply. “But I have never forgotten you.”</p>

<p>It did not occur to him until after the
words were spoken what a lover-like sound
they might have to any one under that false
impression which he had just resented. But
when he lifted his head it was to meet a pair
of eyes which at once enlightened him with
regard to the interpretation of which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
were susceptible. These eyes belonged to the
young man whom he had already seen on the
balcony, and whom Mrs. Meredith now introduced
as Mr. Joscelyn.</p>

<p>Percy Joscelyn had not forgotten the man
whom he found with Aimée on the momentous
occasion when he went to announce the
great change in her fortunes, and he instantly
identified this bronzed stranger as that man,
even before hearing the name which he had
taken care to remember. It was therefore
natural enough that his eyes should express
suspicion and dislike when Lennox met them.</p>

<p>But this immediate proof of Fanny’s assertion,
that he would be regarded as “Aimée’s
former lover,” did not irritate Kyrle as might
have been expected. On the contrary, he was
conscious of a sense of amusement which he
would not have believed possible a moment
earlier. It was the appearance of Joscelyn
which wrought this change. A few minutes
before he had, unconsciously to himself, envied
this man; now <em>he</em> was transformed into an object
if not of envy, at least of apprehension to
the latter. It was impossible not to feel that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
the situation had its elements of interest. He
looked at the beautiful girl standing before
him, a smile still on her lips, but her gentle,
high-bred composure otherwise unchanged,
and felt that, after all, the suspicion of having
been her lover was one which he could cheerfully
support.</p>

<p>Aimée, on her part, regarding him with the
deep, soft eyes he remembered well, was thinking
of the sea wall, the star-lighted tide, and
the young lover who had taken his disappointment
with such fiery disdain. There
rose before her, too, a memory of the orange
grove at sunset, and the generous anger which
had burned there for her rather than for himself.
She knew well that most men in his
place would have given scant thought at such
a time to any one so insignificant as she had
been, and therefore, remembering his deep concern
for the false position in which she was
placed, she had held Lennox Kyrle in grateful
remembrance during all the years since
their one day of brief acquaintance.</p>

<p>Yet it was characteristic of the woman, as
it had been characteristic of the girl, to forget<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
herself for others; and so at this moment she
was thinking less of herself and her own singular
connection with that past story, than of
the two before her, who had been lovers once
and now were strangers. She was wondering
how they felt on meeting again face to face,
and how much or how little the memory of
the past thrilled them. Fanny she knew too
well to expect any depth of feeling from her;
but how was it with Lennox Kyrle?</p>

<p>Meanwhile, amid all these memories, it
was necessary that some one should sustain
conversation with the usual commonplaces;
and of this Mrs. Meredith was fortunately
fully capable.</p>

<p>“I was never more surprised than when I
looked up and saw Mr. Kyrle a few minutes
ago,” she said to Aimée. “And yet there was
really no reason to be surprised at all.”</p>

<p>“Not in these days, when everybody goes
everywhere,” said Lennox, “and the acquaintance
one parted with in Europe yesterday,
one meets to-morrow in China. Especially a
wanderer like myself may be met anywhere.”</p>

<p>“You are a wanderer, then?” said Aimée.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered. “I am a person with
whom you are intimately acquainted&mdash;‘our
special correspondent,’ and therefore my duties
take me to many places.”</p>

<p>“They have brought you to a very delightful
place now,” said she.</p>

<p>“My own inclination has brought me
here,” he replied, and as he uttered the words
he saw a quick flash of suspicion in Percy
Joscelyn’s eyes again.</p>

<p>“Have you been here long?” asked Fanny.
“<em>We</em> came about a week ago; and we are
doing our sight-seeing so leisurely that we
have hardly as yet seen anything at all, except
what can be perceived from a gondola.”</p>

<p>“I arrived only a day or two ago from
Alexandria,” answered Kyrle, “but I am inclined
to think that, for a time, what one perceives
from a gondola&mdash;that is, Venice herself&mdash;may
be best of all.”</p>

<p>“It is,” said Aimée. Upon which the
young man beside her, speaking for the first
time, observed:</p>

<p>“It might be, if Venice were better preserved;
but one grows tired of looking at so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
much decay. In fact, in my opinion, we have
been here quite long enough.”</p>

<p>“Then, my dear Percy,” said Mrs. Meredith,
coolly, “I advise you to take your departure
for any place that you like better, for we,
who have come to Venice for a month, mean
to stay.”</p>

<p>It was not a very amiable glance which
Mr. Joscelyn bestowed upon the speaker, but
he did not answer save by this glance. He
turned instead to Aimée, and said:</p>

<p>“We seem to have lost the rest of our
party. Shall we not go and look for them?”</p>

<p>Before Aimée could reply to this proposal,
the entrance of a party of four made reply unnecessary,
for it was at once apparent that
these were the missing persons whom it was
proposed to seek. Yet they had the appearance
themselves of seeking, rather than of
needing to be sought, for as they entered
they all looked around, and perceiving the
group before the <cite>Paradiso</cite>, eagerly advanced
toward it.</p>

<p>The foremost of these newcomers was a
tall, elaborately dressed young lady&mdash;young, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
least by courtesy&mdash;whose commonplace prettiness
was spoiled by an exceedingly artificial
appearance and manner. With her were a
faded, languid, elderly woman, possessing much
natural elegance and traces of great beauty;
a man of about sixty, carefully got up with
padding and hair-dye to look not more than
forty; and a rotund, florid, genial man of thirty-five
or thereabouts. As these advanced the
young lady spoke:</p>

<p>“I thought we should never find you!
Where have you been hiding yourselves?”</p>

<p>“We have been hiding ourselves where
you see us,” replied Mrs. Meredith. “When
I lose people, I always make a rule of quietly
sitting down and letting them find <em>me</em>, instead
of running about trying to find <em>them</em>. So I
have been sitting here for half an hour in a
conspicuous position; and, as a reward, I have
been found&mdash;not only by you, but by an old
acquaintance who has most unexpectedly appeared.&mdash;Mrs.
Joscelyn, let me present Mr.
Kyrle.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kyrle bowed to the elderly lady, who
at once put up her eyeglass to examine him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
with an alacrity which indicated that his
name was not unknown to her. He was then
presented to Major Joscelyn, to Miss Joscelyn
and to Mr. Meredith; and he was aware
of being regarded with more or less active
suspicion by all of them except Miss Joscelyn,
who smiled as graciously as women of her
order generally do upon an apparently eligible
man.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;ah&mdash;hum&mdash;have heard of Mr. Kyrle,”
observed Major Joscelyn, in a tone which intimated
that he had heard no good of Mr.
Kyrle. Then he fixed a pair of prominent
eyes upon the young man and inquired if he
had been long in Venice.</p>

<p>“Only a few days,” Lennox answered, carelessly.</p>

<p>“Ah&mdash;a few days! And you are leaving
soon?”</p>

<p>“That depends altogether upon circumstances,”
replied Kyrle, who in fact intended
to leave in a day or two, but had no desire to
gratify Major Joscelyn by telling him so; for
already he felt an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">animus</i> of dislike against
these people, not only because of their attitude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
toward himself (for that, being the result of
misconception, only amused him), but from
their appearance and manner. “They are self-seeking
and insincere,” was his judgment, as
his glance passed rapidly from face to face;
and then, turning to the lovely, candid countenance
of Aimée, he thought, “She is like a
dove among hawks.”</p>

<p>Major Joscelyn giving no other reply to
his last remark than a disapproving “Hem!”
Miss Joscelyn took up the conversation, and
remarked that Mr. Kyrle probably found Venice
attractive.</p>

<p>“Very attractive&mdash;especially within the last
half hour,” he replied, with deliberate malice.</p>

<p>The <ins class="corr" id="tn141" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;“The Jocelyns” changed to “The Joscelyns”.">Joscelyns</ins>
looked at each other, while Mr. Meredith glanced at his wife,
and the latter said, quickly:</p>

<p>“Of course, it has become more attractive
within the last half hour. What is pleasanter
than meeting old friends unexpectedly? Mr.
Kyrle is on his way to America from Egypt,”
she added in general explanation, “and it is
the merest chance that we should have met
him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>No one remarked that it was a fortunate
chance. On the contrary, silence appeared to
indicate an altogether different opinion. After a
moment, Major Joscelyn observed that they
had probably seen enough of the Palace of
the Doges for one morning, and that it was
time to think of returning to the hotel.</p>

<p>There was a general movement, and it is
likely that Lennox would have taken a final
farewell of the party there and then, had not
Aimée turned to him with a smile sweet
enough to atone for any degree of incivility
on the part of the others, saying, “And have
you, too, had enough of the Ducal Palace?”</p>

<p>“For the present,” he answered; and availing
himself of what seemed a tacit permission,
he walked by her side as the party passed from
the great hall, along corridors and down staircases
to the court below.</p>

<p>Those few minutes completed the impression
which she had already made upon him;
and an impression in which her beauty played
a small part in comparison with the gracious
simplicity of her manner and the charm of her
voice and glance. There was much in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
voice and glance to remind him of the girl
who had carried Fanny Berrien’s message to
him, who had so timidly offered him her sympathy
and compassion, and who had sat by his
side under the orange boughs. Yet, save in
the dark sweetness of the eyes and the gentle
cadence of the tones, there was surely little in
common between that frightened child and
this stately young lady.</p>

<p>If he had only known it, however, there
was the great thing in common that she was
offering him now, the same sympathy that she
had offered then. She was too young, and of
too limited experience, to have learned the
power of change which lies in time, and it
seemed to her that he must inevitably be
deeply moved by such an unexpected meeting
with the woman he had once loved; and her
gentle kindness was the involuntary form in
which she expressed this feeling. But naturally
no one could be aware of this&mdash;not even
Kyrle himself. He thought that she simply
meant to atone for the incivility of her friends;
the latter cast alarmed glances upon one another;
and Fanny Meredith was no nearer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
the truth than any one else, in saying to herself:
“Aimée is certainly the best creature in
the world! She is throwing herself into the
breach to prevent Tom from being jealous.”</p>

<p>When they reached the Piazza there was a
slight pause of the party, and Kyrle felt that
he was expected to take leave. “Since I have
been so fortunate this morning, I hope to be
fortunate again,” he said to Aimée in clearly
audible tones. “I shall trust to have the
pleasure of meeting you again.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no doubt,” answered she, readily.
“People who know each other can not possibly
fail to meet in Venice. But will you
not come to see us? We are at the Grand
Hotel.&mdash;Fanny, surely you mean to ask Mr.
Kyrle to come to see you?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Kyrle knows that I shall be delighted
to see him,” replied Mrs. Meredith,
“but really we are at home so seldom that it
hardly seems worth while to ask him to come.
As you have just observed, people <em>must</em> meet
when they are in Venice; and their best
chance to meet is away from home, rather
than at home. Nevertheless, I hope you will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
take the chance of finding us in,” said she,
to Kyrle.</p>

<p>“I shall prefer to take the chance of finding
you elsewhere, since you are more likely
to be abroad,” replied he.</p>

<p>“And elsewhere is so much pleasanter
than at home,” interposed Miss Joscelyn.
“The Belle Arti, now&mdash;have you been to the
Belle Arti, Mr. Kyrle?”</p>

<p>Mr. Kyrle replied that he had not. “I
have not been sight-seeing since my arrival,”
he said, “but only lounging.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but you must certainly see the Belle
Arti,” said the young lady with animation.
“You can have no idea of the Venetian
school of art until you have studied it
there.”</p>

<p>“I have no doubt Mr. Kyrle is aware of
that, Lydia,” said Fanny Meredith, dryly; “but
since we have exhaustively done the Belle
Arti&mdash;at least I hope we are done with it&mdash;he
is not likely to meet us there, and it was
of meeting us that he was speaking.”</p>

<p>“It was certainly of meeting you that I
was thinking,” said Lennox.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hum&mdash;ah!” said the major, addressing
his party, “shall we move on?”</p>

<p>Kyrle watched them with a smile as they
moved away across the sunshiny square. He
was saying to himself that it would go hard
with him if he did not see again the beautiful
eyes he had been looking into, and hear the
sweet voice which had just bidden him such a
kindly adieu.</p>



<div class="chapter"></div>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>It was no later than the evening of the
same day before he met the party again. He
was idly sauntering around the arcades of the
Piazza, brilliant with lights and filled with the
sound of many tongues, when he heard a voice
say, “Oh, there is Mr. Kyrle!” and turning, he
encountered Fanny Meredith’s bright glance.
She was sitting at one of the tables near the
door of a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">café</i>, with Aimée, Mr. Meredith, and
young Joscelyn, taking coffee and ices, and as
Lennox paused she went on, gayly:</p>

<p>“Come and join us. You look lonely, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
we are stupid. We know each other so well
that each knows exactly what the other will
say; so, like <cite>Punch’s</cite> married lovers during
the honeymoon, we are ready to welcome a
friend, or even an enemy, so he prove entertaining.”</p>

<p>“But how if one should not prove entertaining?”
asked Kyrle, who needed no second
bidding to take a vacant chair by her
side.</p>

<p>“Then you must have made very poor use
of your opportunities,” said she, “and changed
very much besides&mdash;must he not, Aimée?”</p>

<p>This was audacious, Kyrle thought; but
glancing at Aimée, he was reassured by her
smile.</p>

<p>“When I knew Mr. Kyrle, I was not very
well able to judge of his powers of entertainment,”
she said, “though I have no doubt
they were great.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary, they have always been
of a very limited order,” said Kyrle. “I am
immensely flattered, however, by Mrs. Meredith’s
kind recollection, and only regret my
inability to justify it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>“You have at least improved in modesty,”
said Mrs. Meredith.</p>

<p>“A man who has been in the desert six
months should be modest when he returns
to civilization,” he answered. “Perhaps it is
because I have been in the desert,” he added,
looking around, “that it seems to me one
hardly needs better entertainment than this
scene.”</p>

<p>“It is very bright and interesting for a
while,” said Mr. Meredith; “but fancy coming
here every evening of your life, as these
Venetians do! One would think that it
would grow monotonous in time.”</p>

<p>“To a stranger it would certainly grow
monotonous in a short time,” said Kyrle;
“but those who have all their interests, social
or otherwise, here, and who have a strong
attachment to this which has been the frame
of their life from its beginning, and the frame
of the life of Venice through all her history,
are not likely to grow weary of it.”</p>

<p>“I think,” said Aimée, “that even a
stranger might require some time to grow
weary of it&mdash;such a picture in such a frame!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>“That would depend entirely upon the
stranger,” said Lennox, regarding her with a
smile.</p>

<p>And indeed she was herself a picture worth
regarding as she sat in the light of the brilliant
lamps; her fair, delicate face shadowed by
a large hat covered with curling plumes, and
her liquid eyes full of pleasure as she looked
over the gay life of the Piazza, or turned to
the solemn front of the great cathedral lifting
its domes and minarets against a sky of hyacinth
blue.</p>

<p>“It is a very pretty scene,” said Percy
Joscelyn, superciliously, “but I think it quite
possible to grow tired of it. There is so much
sameness. Now, the boulevards&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Percy is a very good American; his idea
of heaven is a Paris boulevard,” said Fanny
Meredith. “I am fond of the boulevards
myself, but, for a change, I call this delightful.”</p>

<p>Lennox agreed with her. He did not ask
himself why it was so delightful, but he felt
a sense of thorough and complete satisfaction,
as he sat, joining in the light, idle conversation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
commenting on the motley throng
which ebbed and flowed around them, and
drinking a cup of black coffee as if it were
nectar.</p>

<p>Presently Mr. Meredith suggested a return
to their hotel, but this was at once negatived
by his lively wife. “The moon is well up by
this time,” she said. “Let us go out in a gondola.
It will be charming to float about for
an hour or so.”</p>

<p>“Good Heaven!” said the husband, “have
you not been floating about enough during
the course of the day? It seems to me that
we hardly exist out of a gondola, unless we
are in a church or a picture gallery.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, you need not come,” said she,
laughing; “but I know Aimée would like to
go&mdash;would you not, Aimée?”</p>

<p>“I am always ready for a gondola,” was
the smiling reply.</p>

<p>“Percy will go. He is always ready for
a gondola too,” pursued Fanny. Then she
turned to Kyrle. “Will you join us?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“I shall be delighted,” he replied, trying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
not to make the commonplace words too
eager.</p>

<p>“Then we are a nice <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">partie carrée</i>, and we
will go at once,” said she, rising and taking
a shawl from the back of her chair.</p>

<p>No one inquired how far Mr. Meredith
approved of the arrangement. He was left
smoking a cigar in front of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">café</i>, while the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">partie carrée</i> proceeded to the Riva in search
of a gondola.</p>

<p>As was to be expected, Percy took possession
of Aimée, while Lennox found himself
walking by the side of his old love. Neither
of them spoke for a minute or two; then
Fanny turned and glanced at him with a mischievous
smile.</p>

<p>“Time has its recompenses as well as its
revenges occasionally,” she said. “Are you
meditating on that?”</p>

<p>He looked at her and was forced to return
her smile. “You are as full of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">diablerie</i> as
ever,” he said, “but if you have no sense of
compassion, have you not any compunction?”</p>

<p>“Compassion!&mdash;compunction! What fine,
large words! But why should I have either?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
she asked. “You do not need compassion, I
am sure; and as for compunction&mdash;you could
not expect me to be sorry <em>now</em>?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” he answered, with alacrity.
“Regret for what has resulted so well would
be entirely out of place&mdash;for you, that is. For
me, however&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Are you trying to insinuate that you
have any regret?” said she, with a laugh.
“Ah, that pretense is shallow! I have had
such long experience that I can tell, the moment
that I look into a man’s eyes, whether
he feels the smallest bit of sentiment; and you&mdash;as
far as I am concerned&mdash;you have not
enough to put on the point of a pin! Do
you think it strange of me to talk in this
way?”&mdash;He did think so, and his face no
doubt betrayed as much. “But I have a reason.
I want you to understand that I am
not under any foolish delusion about you, as
some women would be. I am anxious that
you should trust me, and let me be your
friend.”</p>

<p>“Pray believe that I trust you entirely,”
said Lennox&mdash;who did not trust her at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>“But a friend&mdash;I am much honored; yet I do
not know that I have special need of a friend
at present.”</p>

<p>“You will never have greater need,” said
she, emphatically, “for you have fallen in love
with Aimée, and, unless I am your friend, the
Joscelyns will not suffer you even to speak to
her.”</p>

<p>“I can well believe that,” said he, involuntarily.
Then he paused and laughed. “But
have I fallen in love with the young lady
whose name is so suggestive of that emotion?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“You are the person to answer the question,”
replied Fanny; “but I should say there
was no doubt of it. I have been watching
you for the last hour, and the entire scheme
has matured beautifully in my mind.”</p>

<p>He looked at her again&mdash;curious, interested,
uncertain what to make of her. The
pretty, piquant face he had once known so
well, was full of animation and amusement as
she turned it toward him, meeting his puzzled
glance.</p>

<p>“You are ungrateful,” she said; “you do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
not trust me; and yet I am anxious to do you
a great service.”</p>

<p>“Granting that I need a service,” said he,
“forgive me if I ask&mdash;why should <em>you</em> wish
to do it?”</p>

<p>“Now, that is more than ungrateful,” said
she. “It is giving me credit for no fine feeling
at all. Though I jest, do you think I do
not remember how badly I treated you once?
It is all over now&mdash;and no doubt you are
grateful enough that it is so. But still the fact
remains. I did treat you badly, and I should
like to be able to feel that I had made some
amend for it. So much for you. Now for
Aimée”&mdash;her voice changed slightly. “Well,
I owe a great deal to Aimée, and I would do
a great deal for her. When it was a question
of serving me, she did not think of herself at
all; and, though I may be frivolous and shallow,
I do not forget this.”</p>

<p>“She certainly did not think of herself at
all,” Kyrle agreed&mdash;looking at the graceful figure
moving in front of them, and remembering
the sea wall of St. Augustine.</p>

<p>“I always said I would repay her if I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
could,” Fanny went on, “and I do not think I
can repay her better than by rescuing her from
the hands that have possession of her now, and
saving her from marrying Percy Joscelyn.”</p>

<p>The last shot struck home. Kyrle was
himself astonished at the sense of consternation
with which he started. “Is that thought
of?” he asked.</p>

<p>“<em>They</em> think of it,” Fanny replied. “They
are ready to move heaven and earth to accomplish
it; but”&mdash;the tone of gleeful malice
which he had heard before came into her
voice&mdash;“I think we may defeat them, you and
I, if you will say the word.”</p>

<p>“What word is it that you wish me to
say?” he asked.</p>

<p>She looked up into his face again with
bright eyes. “What word can it be,” she replied,
“except the simple assertion that you
wish to marry Aimée?”</p>

<p>Fortunately for Kyrle, he had no opportunity
to answer at the moment. They had by
this time reached the Riva, and Joscelyn, turning,
said, “Here is a gondola.”</p>

<p>A few minutes later they were afloat on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
the broad expanse of moonlight-flooded water,
with Venice&mdash;marvelous, mystical, beautiful&mdash;lying
around them. The cabin had been removed
from the gondola, and the ladies took
the two cushioned seats, while the young men
threw themselves down at their feet. And so
they glided out into the silver night.</p>

<p>Surely it was an hour worth living for!
The brilliant lights from the quays streamed
over the water and were reflected in the still
depths below, like an enchanted city; but
this illumination paled before the splendor of
the moonlight that reigned supreme, making
all things visible, yet veiling every defect of
time, for other defects in Venice there are
none. Under this magic light the “glorious
city of the sea” has all her ancient glory still;
one sees no longer the decay which has fallen
over her palaces, but only the loveliness which
made her the wonder of the world. Past
islands, palaces, and domed churches they
glided with that smooth, noiseless movement
which is half the charm of a gondola, and
were soon on the broad lagoon, where the
booming of the Adriatic surf upon the Lido<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
came to their ears like distant thunder&mdash;the
only sound which broke the silence around
them.</p>

<p>The others talked, but Aimée said little.
She leaned back on the broad, easy seat, and
the white radiance falling over her seemed to
intensify all that was spiritual in her beauty,
until she looked rather like a fair dream of a
woman than a creature of flesh and blood.
Lennox pulled his hat low over his eyes in
order that he might watch her unobserved.
His blood was still bounding from that suggestion
of Fanny Meredith’s before they entered
the boat. It had taken away his breath,
yet he felt as if in some intangible way it had
drawn him nearer to this exquisite creature.
It seemed to make that a possibility of which
he had not ventured to dream; and as he
watched the lovely face he was ready to utter
with emphasis the word desired. Here on the
shining water, with the moon beloved of lovers
in all ages looking down, he felt his youth reawakening
with a sense of power and resolve.
He did not think of difficulties or doubts; he
only yielded himself to the strange, sweet enchantment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
which had so unexpectedly overwhelmed
him.</p>

<p>Presently Fanny looked at him curiously,
“Why have you grown so silent?” she asked.
“You and Aimée are not the most lively companions
one might choose.”</p>

<p>“Lively!” repeated Lennox. “If you
wanted liveliness, you should have remained
on the Piazza. This is not the place for it.”</p>

<p>“It seems to me that all places are the
better for it,” said she; “but perhaps that is
because I am a Philistine. However, since
you don’t think this a place for liveliness, suppose
you sing something. It is certainly a
place for music, and we have left all the musicians
behind.”</p>

<p>They had indeed left those gondolas full of
singers, which haunt the Grand Canal and
hover around the hotels of Venice, far behind,
and were floating in the silence of the lustrous
night near San Lazare. Lennox hesitated
and looked at Aimée, who turned her glance
on him.</p>

<p>“Do you sing?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Sing?” repeated Fanny. “He used to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
sing <ins class="corr" id="tn159" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Removed extra double quote.">divinely!</ins>
I suppose he has not forgotten that in the desert.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” said Lennox, with a laugh. “I
have floated on the Nile and sung to myself
many a night.”</p>

<p>“Sing to us now, then, will you not?” said
Aimée.</p>

<p>There was no insistence in her tone, only
a courteous request; but he complied immediately,
as he would no doubt have complied
had she asked him to take a plunge into the
sea. Nor did he require more than an instant
to decide what he would sing. As he watched
her uplifted face with the moonbeams falling
on it, he had been thinking of a song of
Heine’s, and the music&mdash;Schumann’s music&mdash;was
in his throat, as it were; so he began
at once:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">

<div class="stanza">
<p class="verseq">“The lotus flower feareth</p>
<p class="verse2">The splendor of the sun;</p>
<p class="verse0">Bowing her head and dreaming,</p>
<p class="verse2">She waits till the day is done.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="verseq">“The moon he is her lover;</p>
<p class="verse2">He wakes her with silvery light;</p>
<p class="verse0">To him unveils she, smiling,</p>
<p class="verse2">Her flower-face pure and white.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="verseq">“She gazeth on high in silence,</p>
<p class="verse2">Doth bloom and gleam and glow,</p>
<p class="verse0">Exhaling and weeping and trembling</p>
<p class="verse2">For love and love’s deep woe.”</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>
<p>He sang “divinely,” as Fanny had said, for
Nature had given him a voice of the finest
order&mdash;a pure, melodious tenor&mdash;and, though
it had never received much training, there was
something in it to-night which took the place
of training and made it unnecessary&mdash;a thrill
of emotion, a depth of expression, which art
can never teach. When the full, soft notes
sank over the last cadence, Fanny cried out
with admiration, and even Mr. Joscelyn condescended
to say, “Bravo!”</p>

<p>But Aimée did not speak at once, and it
was only when Lennox looked into her “flower-face
pure and white,” that she said, “You
have a great gift, Mr. Kyrle, and a great power
to bestow pleasure.”</p>

<p>The words were kind, but what was there
in the voice that seemed to Kyrle’s ear like a
touch of frost? The exaltation of his mood
sank under it, and he suddenly seemed in his
own eyes to wear very much the aspect of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
fool. What had he been doing? Singing
out his heart to unsympathetic ears, led away
by the magic of the night and the fairness of a
face which, after all, was the face of a stranger,
or, worse yet, of one who knew him only as
the lover of Fanny Meredith. What had possessed
him to take leave of his senses in this
manner? Was this what was likely to happen
to a man when he came out of the desert and
found himself in unaccustomed contact with
civilization again? Did the first lovely face
on which he looked lead his senses astray?</p>

<p>But even as he scornfully asked the question
he knew that it was not so; that the spell
of this face had its root deep in the past, in that
golden evening when he sat under the orange
trees and tried in vain to shake the grateful
loyalty of a child. He knew now that he had
never forgotten that child, and the deep impression
which her absolute unselfishness had
made on him, an impression deeper because it
had been contrasted with such utter selfishness
on the part of another. He had seemed to
come very near to that little maiden of the
past in the hour when her nature and her heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
had been, as it were, laid bare before him; and
so it was to no stranger that he had so quickly
surrendered his own heart, which had long
been swept and garnished and empty of any
occupant.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mrs. Meredith was clamoring
for another song. “You are surely not going
to stop with one!” she cried. “We want another,
and yet another&mdash;don’t we, Aimée?”</p>

<p>“Just as many as Mr. Kyrle will give us,”
responded Aimée, smiling.</p>

<p>It was easier to sing than to talk; so Kyrle
again lifted his voice, this time in a Spanish
serenade as full of the spirit of passionate romance
as a Spanish night. But something
had gone from the singer’s voice, and, charming
as was the song, no one was moved and
thrilled as by the first.</p>



<div class="chapter"></div>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>Fanny Meredith was right in saying that
the Joscelyns watched Aimée and every man
who approached her like dragons. And from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
their point of view, this was natural enough.
Had not Aimée’s fortune lifted them out of
poverty and the embarrassments resulting
therefrom, to a condition of affluence where
all things became easy and agreeable? And
could they be expected to surrender the advantages
of this fortune without a struggle?
It was true that they had enjoyed these advantages
for five or six years, in which time Major
Joscelyn, through whose hands the income
passed, had made not a few excellent investments
on his own account; and that Aimée,
as soon as she attained her majority, had
settled an independence on her mother. Yet
these things did not make them one whit
more inclined to surrender any part of the
heritage which they had grown to consider
their own. Since it was, however, undeniable
that Aimée, although the most gentle and
yielding of human beings, had certain rights
in her own property which the law would
secure to her, and which a husband, should
she marry, might be brutal enough to claim
in her behalf, it became necessary that she
should marry some one who could be trusted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
to consider the Joscelyn interest of primary
importance; and this could only be one of
the Joscelyns themselves. It was therefore
early decreed in the family councils that Percy
Joscelyn should in time marry the young
heiress. There had been considerable consternation
when he returned with her from St.
Augustine and reported a mysterious lover
already on the horizon; especially since inquiries
drew no information concerning this
person from Aimée. “He was a gentleman
whom I knew,” she said, and not even her
mother could obtain from her anything more.</p>

<p>Then Major Joscelyn solemnly announced
that any such thing as a probable or possible
love affair must be promptly nipped in the
bud, and that the quickest and most complete
way to accomplish this was to take the girl
abroad. Her education, which up to this time
had been of the most desultory order, furnished
a good plea, and the entire Joscelyn family
conveyed themselves at once to foreign fields.
They had never returned to America. Nothing
would have been easier than to place
Aimée in a French or German school, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
she would not have required the attention of
her entire family; but that would not have
given an excuse for a residence in Paris, which
they all found very agreeable. So a handsome
establishment was mounted, and after its expenses
were paid, besides the investments on
the major’s account already mentioned, there
was not a great deal to spare for Aimée’s
education. Expensive masters, therefore, she
never had; but very good though not fashionable
teachers can be obtained in Paris for low
prices, and it was not in Aimée’s nature to
make any demands for herself. She took
eager advantage of the scant opportunities
allowed her, and accomplished an education
for which she had little to thank her guardians.</p>

<p>There was some uneasiness in the family
mind when the time of her majority approached;
but it passed quietly, and, whether
through indifference, or ignorance of the full
extent of her power, she made no attempt to
take the control of her income from Major
Joscelyn’s hands. So things had gone on as
usual, and the family were hoping that before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
very long Percy might come into possession of
the much-coveted fortune, when who should
appear on the scene but Fanny Meredith!
At once the Joscelyns felt that the time had
come when they would have to fight for
Aimée. They no longer had legal control
of her movements; and although she still
yielded submission to the wishes of her mother
(which meant the wishes of Major Joscelyn),
they instinctively felt that it would not
do to try this submissiveness too far. So,
when Mrs. Meredith proposed that Aimée
should join her husband and herself in a tour
through Italy, the Joscelyns held a council of
war, and decided that, while it was impossible
to allow her to go, it was equally unadvisable
to strain obedience too far. The brilliant
mind of Major Joscelyn again found the remedy.
“We will <em>all</em> go,” he said. “It is not&mdash;ahem!&mdash;what
one would desire, to wander
about Italian cities for several months; but
Aimée can not be trusted with this flighty
woman, who would not only introduce all
manner of&mdash;hum&mdash;dangerous acquaintances to
her, but who would delight to undermine our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
influence. Neither will it do to positively
refuse to let her go; so we must sacrifice ourselves
and accompany her.”</p>

<p>The sacrifice, therefore, to Fanny Meredith’s
great disgust, was made. The family
picked themselves up, and in solid phalanx accompanied
their heiress to Italy, keeping vigilant
watch and ward over her and over every
possible dangerous acquaintance whom she
made. But they were little prepared for the
unkind stroke of Fate which brought Lennox
Kyrle across their path. That his appearance
in Venice was an accident they did not believe
for an instant. They strongly suspected
that Fanny Meredith had, together with him,
planned this appearance to take place when
Aimée should have been removed from her
family environment. They congratulated themselves
that so much, at least, had been frustrated
by their foreseeing vigilance, but they
had not the least doubt that Kyrle had come
with the determination to secure her hand and
fortune, if that desirable end could be attained
by unholy arts and incredible audacity. What
was to be done to frustrate and check this audacity?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Such was the question the family met
in solemn conclave to consider on the day after
the undesirable intruder had appeared.</p>

<p>“He is not to be shaken off easily,” said
Percy Joscelyn, “for Mrs. Meredith encourages
him in every way. Last night she not
only invited him to join us as we sat outside
Florian’s, but she proposed going out in a
gondola, took him along, and made him sing.
He sings uncommonly well&mdash;confound him!&mdash;and
almost made love to Aimée before my
eyes.”</p>

<p>“The fellow’s impudence seems to be equal
to anything!” said the major. “And how did
Aimée receive his&mdash;ah&mdash;advances?”</p>

<p>“You can never tell much about Aimée,”
his son answered. “She is quiet, and she’s
deep. She didn’t seem responsive, but that
signifies nothing. Under ordinary circumstances
I might think that he had made no
impression on her; but these are not ordinary
circumstances, and the trouble is that we don’t
know what the extent of their first acquaintance
was. Although Mrs. Berrien denied it, I
shall always believe that there had been some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
love-making going on between them in St.
Augustine.”</p>

<p>“And yet Aimée was certainly not very attractive
at that time,” observed Miss Joscelyn.</p>

<p>“There’s no accounting for tastes,” said her
brother, curtly, “and facts are facts. I <em>saw</em>
him give her a locket&mdash;something which, you
know, she always declined to explain.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mrs. Joscelyn, with a sigh, “she
was very obstinate and as close as wax. But I
have always had an idea that he was not a
lover, because, in the first place, she said so&mdash;and
Aimée always told the truth&mdash;and, in the
second place, because she never seemed to
have any fancy for lovers, like other girls.&mdash;You
know, Lydia, how often you have remarked
that Aimée was so old-fashioned in this
respect.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” assented Lydia, “but, as Percy says,
Aimée is deep, and I don’t really feel that I
know very much about her. As for the matter
of the locket, though,” added the speaker with
a sudden gleam of intuition, “that was as likely
as not one of Fanny Meredith’s tricks. She
was an outrageous flirt!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>“If I thought so!” exclaimed Percy Joscelyn,
with a start. His eyes flashed as he
spoke. Many a score had he to pay Fanny
Meredith, who in truth took a malicious pleasure
in frustrating his attempts to establish a
claim upon Aimée; and if it were possible to
bring anything out of the past against her,
how delighted he would be to use it remorselessly!
“But there is not the least proof of
such a thing,” he said, almost resentfully, to his
sister.</p>

<p>“No; it was only an idea that occurred to
me,” she replied; “but I know what Fanny
Berrien was, and I believe that, if you could
induce Aimée to speak, you would find that
it was so.”</p>

<p>“Then, in that case,” said the major, “you
don’t believe the man was Aimée’s lover at
all?”</p>

<p>“It does not matter what she believes,”
Percy somewhat rudely interposed. “Opinions,
without any ground of proof, amount to
nothing. I know what I saw, and I know
that the fellow has eyes only for Aimée now;
and that Mrs. Meredith, as I have already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
said, encourages him by every means in her
power.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said the major, sharply, “one thing
is certain: Aimée can not be allowed to go
out with the Merediths.”</p>

<p>“How will you prevent it?” Percy asked.
“The last thing advisable is to force her to
declare her independence of us, and any ill-judged
attempt at control would do this.
Nothing would please Mrs. Meredith better
than to prompt her to such a course. No;
watchfulness is our only resource&mdash;watchfulness,
and perhaps stratagem. If it were possible
to leave Venice now&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That would be the best thing,” said the
major, “only&mdash;ah&mdash;what is to prevent this
objectionable person from following us?”</p>

<p>“If that were all,” said Percy, “I should
leave at once, and trust to luck or the shortness
of his purse to prevent his following.
But the real objection is that we could not be
certain that Aimée would consent to go; and
we could neither force her to do so nor leave
her with the Merediths. So, departure is not
to be thought of. We must fight the thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
out by watchfulness and stratagem, as I have
said.”</p>

<p>“Watchfulness&mdash;yes,” said his father, “that
is plain, and of course necessary; but what
stratagem do you propose?”</p>

<p>“I propose, for one thing, that some person
shall always take charge of Mr. Kyrle, and
prevent him from devoting himself to Aimée.”</p>

<p>“But how is any one to take charge of
Mr. Kyrle&mdash;without his consent?” asked Mrs.
Joscelyn, feebly.</p>

<p>“A man’s consent is always taken for
granted where a lady is concerned,” young
Joscelyn answered. “Lydia, here, might be
equal to the delicate task, I think. All that is
required is that she shall quietly take possession
of Mr. Kyrle on all occasions, and make
it impossible for him to attach himself to
Aimée.&mdash;It is a task after your own heart,” he
went on, addressing his sister with more than
the suspicion of a brotherly sneer in his tone
“I have seen you on many occasions monopolize
men very much against their will. Do you
think you can manage the same thing with
Kyrle?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>A flush rose to her cheek and was visible
through the powder that covered it. “You
are as insulting as usual,” she said.</p>

<p>“On the contrary, I am most flattering,”
he returned, suavely&mdash;for he felt that Lydia’s
assistance was essential at this juncture of
affairs. “Only a woman of rare powers can do
these things. A stupid woman or a clumsy
woman can never succeed in them. It requires
a peculiar tact to take possession of a
man and keep him fastened to your side
whether he likes or not.”</p>

<p>“I understand perfectly all that you mean
to imply,” she said, coldly; “and if I do this
thing it is not out of regard for you or your
plans, but because I have an object of my own
in it.”</p>

<p>“Whatever your object,” her brother replied,
“only <em>do</em> the thing, and I shall be satisfied,
and never doubt your powers again.”</p>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>But while the family council was thus
laying plans for keeping Aimée and her old
acquaintance apart, Fortune, which sometimes
takes up weapons and fights for those who
have neither heart nor power to fight for
themselves, had most unexpectedly brought
them together.</p>

<p>It was quite early in the morning, soon
after he had taken that light collation which
on the Continent is called the first breakfast,
that Kyrle, sauntering on the Piazza and asking
himself whether he should fulfill his engagement
of calling on Mrs. Meredith, or whether
he should, more sensibly, leave Venice, these
old entanglements, and new perils, behind him,
suddenly perceived a lady, accompanied by
her maid, just entering the great portal of the
cathedral. He had not sat behind that figure
the day before and studied it in vain. He
recognized at once the elegant outlines, the
graceful carriage, and without a moment’s hesitation
he followed her into the church, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
had long ago followed her into the Florida
orange grove.</p>

<p>Who does not know by sight or by fame
that wonderful interior in whose darkness lies
hid the spoils of the Orient, and whose ancient
pavement in its undulations seems to
imitate the waves of the sea that cradles it?
Kyrle knew it well; but just now he was not
thinking of gorgeous mosaics, or marvelous
carving, of columns of verd-antique, jasper, or
porphyry; his eyes were searching the gloom
of the vast edifice for the figure which had
entered a few minutes before, and some time
elapsed before he discovered what he sought,
in a chapel where a priest was saying mass
and a small congregation were assembled.</p>

<p>As he drew near the chapel, struck by the
infinitely picturesque scene&mdash;the rich, jewel-incrusted
altar, the priest in his golden vestments,
the contrasts of rank and costume in
the forms kneeling on the pavement&mdash;he suddenly
saw Aimée, her maid on one side, on
the other a Venetian girl with a black lace
shawl thrown over such red-gold hair as Titian
painted, while a shaft of sunlight from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
some high, remote window brought out the
delicate fairness of her face from the shadowy
obscurity around. Satisfied with having found
the object of his search, Kyrle paused, and, leaning
against a pillar, waited until the service
was over and those who had assisted thereat
were dispersing. Then he stepped from the
shadow of the pillar and presented himself to
Aimée. She looked a little surprised, but
greeted him quietly, and together they walked
toward the entrance.</p>

<p>“I was about to remark that I am fortunate
to meet you,” Kyrle said presently, “but
one should pay a sacred edifice the compliment
of being strictly truthful while within its walls,
shouldn’t one? And the truth in this case is
that I saw you come in and followed you.
I am thinking of leaving Venice to-day.”</p>

<p>If he had intended to surprise her by the
announcement, he must have been disappointed
by the calmness with which she replied:
“You are leaving Venice to-day? Is not
that sooner than you anticipated?”</p>

<p>“I had made no plans,” he answered.
“When I paused here, I did not intend to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
linger more than a few days. And now,
though I am strongly tempted to remain, I&mdash;Well,
I think I had better go.”</p>

<p>Almost every one has had occasion to learn
more than once in life the extreme difficulty
of keeping all trace of strong feeling out of
the voice. Kyrle was conscious of being somewhat
exasperated with himself and Fate, as
he uttered the last words, and naturally the
inflection of his tone betrayed the feeling.
Aimée glanced at him quickly&mdash;involuntarily,
it appeared&mdash;and in the light of that glance
there suddenly flashed upon him an understanding
of what interpretation she might give
to his words. Her eyes seemed to say, “Ah,
is <em>that</em> it!” But before he could collect his
thoughts sufficiently to know how to explain
himself, she had looked away again and was
saying in her clear, low voice: “If you think
it best, of course you are right to go. And
one should not attempt to change your resolution.”</p>

<p>“No one is likely to attempt to change it,”
he replied, with a slight laugh. “But I think
you misunderstand me a little,” he added,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
after a pause, with a sudden impulse of candor.
“We were once thrown together very
singularly; I am sure you do not forget this
any more than I do. Therefore, since we are
not strangers, will you let me speak to you
frankly?”</p>

<p>“Surely, if you wish to do so,” she answered;
but he saw that she looked a little
startled.</p>

<p>“Do not be afraid,” he said, quietly. “I
have no intention of saying anything that you
need hesitate to hear. But may I ask you to
sit down for a moment?”</p>

<p>They were now in the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">atrium</i>, or inner
porch of the church. Aimée hesitated for an
instant, then, turning to her maid, said in
French:</p>

<p>“Go to the Merceria and make the purchases
of which you spoke. I will wait for
you here.”</p>

<p>“Oui, mademoiselle,” replied the girl, without
the change of a feature, and forthwith departed.</p>

<p>Kyrle could hardly believe his good fortune,
but as Aimée sat down on one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
stone benches fixed against the wall, he said,
gratefully:</p>

<p>“You are very kind&mdash;as kind as I remember
you of old. And I have no more forgotten
how kind you were then, than I have
ceased to thank Heaven for the message you
so bravely brought me.”</p>

<p>She looked up at him and he saw in her
face that she was astonished.</p>

<p>“But&mdash;” she began, and then paused.</p>

<p>“But you thought that I meant something
else a minute ago,” he said. “You thought I
meant that I found it best to go because I
felt the old attraction reviving. Is it not so?”</p>

<p>She dropped her eyes. “Was it not natural
that I should think so?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it was natural,” he answered, “but
you were mistaken. My only sentiment with
regard to that past folly is one of sincerest
thankfulness for my escape. The last time we
sat like this together&mdash;have you forgotten the
evening in the orange grove?&mdash;I told you
that my fancy for Fanny Berrien was dead,
killed by her duplicity to me and her selfishness
toward you. I may have been a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
melodramatic, but I meant exactly what I
said. From that day to this her memory has
not cost me a pang. As for Mrs. Meredith,
she is a very pretty and amusing person, who
acted altogether according to her kind, and to
whom for her conduct toward myself I bear
no malice whatever. On the contrary, my
sentiment toward her is one of lively gratitude&mdash;although
I have never forgiven her for
her conduct toward you.”</p>

<p>Aimée had lifted her eyes now, and was
looking at him again very steadily. It was
as if she were deciding in her own mind the
question of his sincerity. Then she said, with
her old simplicity and directness:</p>

<p>“But why do you wish to tell this to me?”</p>

<p>“Because,” he answered, “whether I go or
whether I stay, I do not wish you to regard
me as the victim of a hopeless passion for the
wife of Mr. Meredith.”</p>

<p>“I should scarcely have thought that,” she
answered; “but it was surely natural to fancy
that you might remember&mdash;with pain&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; it is no matter for pain,” he said,
as she hesitated&mdash;“only for a light-comedy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
smile and sigh. Fancies of that sort come
and go like dreams. One must know many
of them before one learns what love really
is.”</p>

<p>She turned her dark, meditative eyes away
from him. On one side was the interior of
the marvelous old church, gleaming with
marbles and precious stones; on the other
the sunshiny Piazza, with its graceful arcades
and flocks of sheeny pigeons. She looked
toward the last as she said:</p>

<p>“I do not think I like such an idea.”</p>

<p>“You?” he said, quickly. “No; how
could <em>you</em> like it? It is not meant to apply to
natures like yours.”</p>

<p>“Is it not?” she asked, with a smile. “But
how can you tell that, when you know nothing
of my nature?”</p>

<p>“Do you think I know nothing of your
nature?” he asked, smiling also. “If I had
time, and you did not consider me too presumptuous,
I might prove the contrary, for
you forget all that you showed me once&mdash;all
the courage, the unselfishness, the humility.
But I do not forget. And has no one ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
told you that you carry your soul on your
lips and your heart in your eyes?”</p>

<p>“No,” she replied, “I do not remember
that any one ever told me so before&mdash;at least
not exactly. But perhaps Fanny means the
same thing when she tells me that my face is
‘ridiculously transparent.’”</p>

<p>“It is only a different way of stating the
same thing,” said Kyrle, and then they both
laughed.</p>

<p>“But seriously,” said he, after a moment,
conscious of a very pleasant sense of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">camaraderie</i>
with this beautiful companion, “have
you no idea how you revealed yourself to me
at that last meeting of ours under the orange
trees? How I can see you this moment, as
you were then&mdash;such a delicate, childlike
creature, but with a strength of resolution
against which I arrayed all <em>my</em> strength in
vain! And then, when you opened your heart
and told me the sad story of your life, and
how it was gratitude which made you so
resolute&mdash;do you think I could ever forget
anything so touching? Many a time, in the
years which have passed since then, I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
thought of that scene, and said to myself,
‘God bless that child wherever she may
be, for she has a heart as tender as it is
brave!’”</p>

<p>Something in his voice told her that he
was speaking genuinely, without the least insincerity
or thought of effect, and she could
not but give him a grateful glance from the
same dark eyes which had impressed him with
their wonderful power of expression on the
occasion of which he spoke. “You are very
kind,” she said, trying to speak lightly, “to
have remembered an obstinate child so long!”</p>

<p>“You were certainly very obstinate,” he
said; “but how brave you were! To think
of your having had the courage to go alone
to the sea wall that night, and to think of the
selfishness and cowardice that sent you! Pardon
me for asking the question, but has no
opportunity ever occurred for you to set yourself
right in that matter?”</p>

<p>She shook her head. “How could it?”
she asked. “Fanny has never had the courage
to tell her husband the truth. But nothing
disagreeable has arisen from it&mdash;to me, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
mean,” she added, a little hurriedly. “You
know you were afraid of that.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said. “I am very glad that you
have never been annoyed; still, it is a shame
that such a belief should be in the mind of
any one with regard to you.”</p>

<p>He spoke out, quickly and hotly, the indignation
that on this subject was always
within him and ready to find expression; but
he was sorry the next moment for the words
when he saw a swift blush rise into her face, as
with the sudden realization of what the belief
was to which he alluded. Angry with himself,
he went on hastily:</p>

<p>“This being so&mdash;I mean, the burden of
Mrs. Meredith’s conduct being still borne by
you&mdash;I feel that I am bound to abstain on my
part from anything which might cause you the
least annoyance; and so I have determined
to go away. There shall not be the least misapprehension
about you, arising from any act
of mine.”</p>

<p>So much was truth; but, like many other
people, Kyrle did not find it advisable to
tell all the truth. He could not say, “Also, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
am going, because if I stay I shall fall in love
with you, and that will never do, for I am a
poor man, and you are a rich woman.” But
this was in his mind, even while the temptation
was growing greater every instant to forget
both of these stubborn facts. Aimée was
silent for a moment, and then&mdash;for the old
courage, as well as the old simplicity, was still
strong in her&mdash;she looked at him with her
brave, direct glance, and said:</p>

<p>“If this is your reason for leaving Venice,
I hope that you will not think of going.
Your presence does not cause me the least annoyance;
and I should be more sorry than I
can tell you if mine were such an annoyance
to you that we could not even remain in the
same city. For, do you think I forget that if
you are in a false position, it was my obstinacy
that placed, or at least kept you there?
How earnestly you appealed to me, and I
could not yield! And are you now to be the
sufferer by being driven away from this heavenly
place? No, Mr. Kyrle, there is no justice
in that. I will not allow it!”</p>

<p>He could have smiled at the energy with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
which she spoke, partly because he read in it
the old generous spirit, taking no heed or
thought of herself, and partly because, in
urging him to remain, she proved that she so
little suspected the chief reason why departure
seemed to him necessary. What he would
have answered it is hard to say, for at that moment
the maid, bearing some packages, made
her appearance, and Aimée, rousing to the consciousness
that there was something very unconventional
in this prolonged conversation,
rose rather hastily, bade him good-morning,
and walked away.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Going to leave Venice?” said Fanny
Meredith. “What an absurd idea! What do
you mean by it?”</p>

<p>The time was two hours later than when,
standing in the shadow of the cathedral porch,
Kyrle had watched Aimée cross the sunshine-flooded
Piazza; and the place was the privacy
of Mrs. Meredith’s sitting-room in the Grand
Hotel. The two people who occupied it were
alone together for the first time since they had
parted as lovers; but it is safe to say that this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
thought was not in the mind of either of them.
Kyrle, leaning back in a deep chair, was gazing
absently out of the window at the beautiful
proportions of Santa Maria della Salute just
across the Grand Canal, while Mrs. Meredith,
with her pretty brows knitted, was gazing at
<em>him</em>.</p>

<p>“I mean,” he said slowly, in reply to her
last words, “that I think it is the only wise
course open to me.”</p>

<p>She threw herself back with an impatient
gesture. “You are as incomprehensible as
ever!” she exclaimed. “Now, what on earth
do you mean by the only wise course open to
you?”</p>

<p>“Briefly, then,” said Kyrle, “you were
shrewd enough to observe last night that I
am in danger of falling in love with Miss
Vincent&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” said Fanny, shaking her head,
“I observed that the thing was already accomplished.”</p>

<p>“There you are mistaken,” said he; “it is
not already accomplished. Or if it were,” he
added, lamely, “there is the more reason for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
my going away, since I only expose myself to
useless pain by remaining.”</p>

<p>“But why useless pain?” asked she. “Have
you so faint a heart that you are afraid of
Percy Joscelyn as a rival?”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” answered he, calmly. “But
it is quite impossible for me to become his
rival. Have you not told me that Miss Vincent
is a great heiress?”</p>

<p>“Yes; she has a large fortune in her own
right, and without any restrictions&mdash;happy
girl!”</p>

<p>“I hope it may prove for her happiness,”
said Kyrle, rather gloomily, “but it is an
effectual bar to any hope on my part. A
newspaper correspondent would hardly be a
fit <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parti</i> for such an heiress.”</p>

<p>“And whose fault is it that you are a
newspaper correspondent?” asked Mrs. Meredith,
with a malice born of past recollections.
“But, in my opinion, that is all nonsense,”
she went on, briskly. “Birth and social position
are the things to be considered, rather
than a mere accident of money.”</p>

<p>“The accident of money is what the world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
considers,” said he, “and I must consider it
also. For myself, I have perhaps thought of
it too little. If so, I am punished by finding
it now an insuperable barrier between myself
and the woman I might love.”</p>

<p>Fanny opened her lips to speak, but apparently
thought better of it before any words
escaped. She closed them again and sat silent
for a moment, evidently reflecting. Then she
looked at Kyrle with an expression of resigned
regret.</p>

<p>“I remember how ob&mdash;that is, determined
you are,” she said; “so I suppose there is
nothing to be gained by arguing the matter.
But since your mind is so fully made up,
why should you run away? I thought that
was the resource of weakness and indecision.”</p>

<p>“No doubt it is,” said he, falling into the
artful trap, “and I felt very weak last night,
I assure you. But, after all, there is no reason
why I should go at once&mdash;” looking out at
the enchanting sea and sky, and remembering
Aimée’s last words. “A day or two can not
matter, and it is nobody’s affair but my own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
if I choose to pay for present pleasure by
future pain.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, no&mdash;not anybody’s affair at all,”
said Fanny. “And then, you can so easily
take another trip to Egypt and forget all
about it. I really wish you would stay,” she
added, persuasively. “We might have such a
pleasant time wandering about Venice! And
a man need not abjure the society of a
woman because he thinks her too rich to
marry.”</p>

<p>“No, certainly not,” said Lennox, though
he knew in his heart that this was sophistry.
“Well, at least I will not go to-day. I will
stay as long as I first intended&mdash;that is, two
or three days longer.”</p>

<p>“How nice of you!” said Fanny, with a
gleam of triumph in her eyes. “And you
will also stay to breakfast?”</p>

<p>“You are very kind, but not to-day. If
you are going anywhere this afternoon, however,
and will allow me to join you&mdash;”</p>

<p>“We are going out to the Lido. Meet
us there, and we can all return together. And
one word&mdash;don’t mind the incivility of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
Joscelyns. They are uncivil because they are
afraid of you.”</p>

<p>“I am very well aware of that,” said he,
with a smile. Then his heart sank, and his
voice also, as he added, “But if they only
knew it, they have no cause for fear.”</p>

<p>“They are wiser than to believe that. And
so am I,” thought Fanny; but she took very
good care not to utter her thought aloud.</p>



<div class="chapter"></div>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>Somewhat to Mrs. Meredith’s and also to
Kyrle’s own surprise, he had no incivility to
encounter from any of the Joscelyns when he
joined their party on the Lido that afternoon.
The heads of the family received him courteously,
if stiffly, and Miss Joscelyn greeted him
like an old friend. Indeed, by what means he
could not for the life of him tell, she soon
managed to monopolize his attention, calling
upon him for the little services which no
gentleman can refuse to render to a woman,
and presently drawing him aside from the rest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
of the party to walk with her on the beach,
while she discoursed to him of many things in
heaven and earth which did not interest him in
the least. His judgment upon her, meanwhile,
was uncompromising.</p>

<p>“A mass of silliness and affectation,” he said
to himself, but in this he did her some injustice.
She was not only less silly than he imagined&mdash;possessing,
in fact, a good deal of
shrewdness&mdash;but at the present time she had
an object in view in her discursive conversation
which his irritated and distracted mind
was far from perceiving.</p>

<p>For it is to be feared that, had pearls of wit
and wisdom dropped from her lips, they would
have fallen on equally inattentive ears. Kyrle
had said sternly to himself, while on his way to
the Lido, that he would be very careful not to
devote himself to Aimée; that, because she had
asked him to remain in Venice, he was the
more bound not to cause her the faintest shadow
of annoyance by attentions that might be
misconstrued; and that he would only allow
himself the pleasure of seeing and of talking
to her, as any other chance acquaintance might.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
But to renounce voluntarily some happiness
for which Nature longs is one thing, and to
have it forcibly placed beyond reach by outside
agency is another. Even if the happiness in
question is no more than looking into a pair of
soft, dark eyes, and listening to ordinary sentences
uttered in a sweet voice, one may be
supported in voluntary renunciation by a sense
of virtue which is altogether lacking in feeling
that the matter is taken out of one’s own power.
So Kyrle chafed inwardly against the quiet but
resolute hold of Miss Joscelyn upon his attention,
even while he said to himself that it was
in a degree what he had intended, and that he
was glad of an opportunity to prove to these
people what an absurd fiction it was that he
had ever been Aimée’s lover.</p>

<p>Yet all the time he was conscious of an insistent
desire, the hunger of the heart which
comes with love, to renew the charm of that
half hour in the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">atrium</i> of St. Mark’s, to take
up the thread of conversation where they had
dropped it, and feel again that sense of sympathy
and comradeship, of understanding and
being understood, which had quickened all his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
being into new life. And, instead of this, he
was pacing the beach with Lydia Joscelyn, and
lending half an ear to what he called in his own
mind empty twaddle.</p>

<p>Twaddle it might be, but empty&mdash;that is,
devoid of meaning&mdash;it was not. Lydia, with an
art which did her credit, approached slowly but
surely to the point she had distinctly in view;
and presently she touched it.</p>

<p>“Percy tells me that you sing beautifully,
Mr. Kyrle,” she said. “He declares that he
never heard anything finer than your singing
in the gondola last night. You must come out
with us to-night and let me hear you. I adore
fine singing. I wonder that Aimée never
mentioned that you had such a fine voice.”</p>

<p>Kyrle, roused from partial abstraction by
the sound of Aimée’s name, fell unconsciously
into the trap. “I do not think that Miss Vincent
knew anything about my voice,” he replied,
“so it would have been difficult for her
to say anything about it.”</p>

<p>“No!” said his companion, opening her
eyes. “I thought I had understood that you
were <em>quite</em> old friends.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>This roused him thoroughly, for the tone
implied much more than the words. The indignation
which was ever ready to be excited
on this point rose within him, as it had risen
before that day. He determined that nothing
should induce him to lend his aid to Fanny
Berrien’s deception, and allow these people to
fancy injurious things of Aimée. Miss Joscelyn
was a little startled by the haughtiness of
his glance as he turned it on her.</p>

<p>“I could esteem nothing more of an honor,”
he said, stiffly, “than to have been either
an old or a new friend of Miss Vincent. But,
in point of fact, our acquaintance in the past
was very slight, as your knowledge that she
was quite a child at the time might inform you.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Miss Joscelyn. Even her self-possession
had need to recover itself after this
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">douche</i> of cold water. But, while she exclaimed
mentally that he was a perfect churl,
her resentment was accompanied by a sense of
triumph. “There <em>is</em> a mystery,” she thought,
“and I am sure that Fanny Meredith is at the
bottom of it!” With a laudable desire of
probing further, therefore, she went on:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>“We have all misunderstood a little, then,”
she said, with some significance. “There has
been an impression created&mdash;not so much by
Aimée as by Mrs. Meredith&mdash;that you were
friends in a very particular sense. I think,”
she added, with an air of carefully weighing
her words, “that it is a pity such an impression
should be allowed to remain, if it does Aimée
an injustice.”</p>

<p>“If such an impression exists,” said Kyrle,
with emphasis, “it certainly does Miss Vincent
the greatest injustice, and should not be permitted
to remain. I repeat that my acquaintance
with her was very slight, and that I
thought of her only as a child, though I was
struck by some qualities very remarkable in a
child, which she displayed.”</p>

<p>“It is singular, since your acquaintance
with her was so slight, that you should have
been able to discover these qualities,” observed
Miss Joscelyn, innocently, “for Aimée is <em>very</em>
reserved, very secretive, one may say, in her
nature.”</p>

<p>“There were circumstances which called
out the qualities,” said Kyrle, briefly; for he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
began to understand that he was being subjected
to a process vulgarly known as pumping,
and he had no idea of either gratifying
Miss Joscelyn’s curiosity or betraying Fanny
Meredith’s secret, unless defense of Aimée
should make the last absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>“It is rather difficult to imagine what circumstances
calculated to draw out remarkable
qualities could have thrown together a shy
child like Aimée and a young man like yourself,”
said Miss Joscelyn, musingly. She
glanced at him, and since the expression of
his face said plainly that he declined to be
communicative regarding these circumstances,
she proved her talent for cross-examination by
a swift and unexpected diversion:</p>

<p>“What a very attractive girl Fanny Berrien
was at that time! Speaking of your acquaintance
with Aimée reminds me that it
was during that winter in Florida she became
engaged to Mr. Meredith. It was said that
she jilted another man shamefully&mdash;some one
to whom she had been engaged a long time&mdash;in
order to marry him.”</p>

<p>“Very likely,” responded Kyrle, feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
bound to make some comment. “I should
imagine that Mrs. Meredith was never inclined
to limit herself in strings to her bow.”</p>

<p>“She was always a dreadful flirt!” said
Lydia, shaking her head with an air of virtuous
reprobation. “I fancy Mr. Meredith does
not know a quarter of her escapades.”</p>

<p>“Are we not always informed that, where
ignorance is bliss, only folly would desire to
be wise?” replied Kyrle, impatiently. “But
shall we not return to your party? I think I
see some one waving to us.”</p>

<p>Some one was indeed waving energetically
and when they reached the group they
found them in readiness to embark on the
return voyage. In fact, the Merediths, Aimée,
and Percy Joscelyn already filled one gondola.
Fanny met Kyrle’s crestfallen look with a
mocking gleam in her eye.</p>

<p>“All things do <em>not</em> come to him who
waits too long,” she said, oracularly. “Had
you been a little earlier, I might have offered
you a place with us; but now you
will have to return as you came, alone, unless
Lydia allows you to recline at her feet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>“We shall be very happy if Mr. Kyrle will
come with us,” said the major, blandly.</p>

<p>But Mr. Kyrle declined, more emphatically
than was necessary. His own gondola was
waiting, he said, and (this the merest and
vaguest politeness), since he was alone, could
he not offer a seat to any one?</p>

<p>Miss Joscelyn and her brother exchanged
glances, and then the young lady sweetly
spoke: “Since you are so kind, Mr. Kyrle&mdash;it
really <em>is</em> too bad for you to have to return
alone&mdash;and as there are only two comfortable
seats in a gondola, I will give mine to papa
and come with you.”</p>

<p>She held out her hand to be assisted into
the boat, and Kyrle, mentally anathematizing
his own politeness, muttered that he was “delighted,”
Fanny Meredith laughed rather irrelevantly,
and they all pushed off.</p>

<p>What a picture it was when they were
floating on the wide lagoon, with Venice rising
before them out of the shining waters, its
domes and towers enveloped in the golden
haze of sunset, like some dream of fancy, too
magically fair for reality! In such an hour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
and scene, who does not long for sympathetic
companionship? Poor Kyrle at least did, as
instinctively he glanced toward the gondola
that held Aimée, and thought how different all
this glory of earth and sky, all the enchanted
<ins class="corr"  id="tn200" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;“lovelness of the most poetical” changed to “loveliness of the most poetical”">loveliness</ins>
of the most poetical spot on earth,
would have appeared to him had he been able
to see it reflected in her eyes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Upon my word, Lydia, you astonished
me this afternoon!” Mr. Percy Joscelyn condescended
to say to his sister that evening.
“I really had no idea of your ability before.
You managed the situation perfectly. I never
saw anything better done than the way you
took possession of Kyrle.” He laughed softly.
“The fellow’s face, when he stepped into his
gondola, was a study!”</p>

<p>Lydia flushed at the laugh. She was
pleased to be commended&mdash;to have proved
conclusively that she had power to do what
she had undertaken; but her vanity suffered
under the imputation that she had forced
herself upon an unwilling man. No woman
likes to feel this. Even if it be a fact, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
conceals it as far as possible from herself, and
never forgives the person who thrusts it brutally
before her.</p>

<p>“I did not find it at all difficult to monopolize
Mr. Kyrle, as you call it,” she said, with a
tone of offense in her voice. “He did not
seem to object to being monopolized. And
about Aimée&mdash;I have found out just what I
expected&mdash;he never was her lover at all.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?” asked her brother,
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Because he told me so. Oh, you need not
laugh! I was not foolish enough to ask the
question as a question; I made him tell me
what I wanted to know without his hardly
being aware that he was telling it. I think I
remember all the conversation. It was like
this&mdash;”</p>

<p>She proceeded to give a fairly accurate report
of it, to which Percy listened with the
keenest attention, and, when she finished, admitted
that her conclusions were probably
right.</p>

<p>“I agree with you that it was most likely
some tricky game of Fanny Berrien’s, in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
she used Aimée as a blind,” he said. “And,
late in the day as it is, there is nothing I should
like so much as to get on the track of it and
expose her. But we have no proof&mdash;none
whatever&mdash;for you say this fellow will not
speak, and we know that Aimée will not.”</p>

<p>“He may speak&mdash;that is, he may give me
information without intending to do so, as he
did this afternoon,” Lydia calmly replied. “I
don’t despair of finding out the whole thing;
but, after all, it has no great bearing on the
present state of affairs.”</p>

<p>“More than you imagine,” her brother
said. “A hold on Mrs. Meredith would be
the most useful thing possible to me just now.
If, as I don’t doubt, this man was an old
lover of hers, she has not only deceived her
husband with regard to him, but she is now
bringing him forward as a suitor for Aimée.
Give me one iota of proof of the story we both
believe, and I will go to her and say: ‘You
have probably still sufficient influence over Mr.
<ins class="corr" id="tn202" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Added single quote after “Kyrle to send him away”"> Kyrle to send him away.’</ins>
If not, I shall have the pleasure of telling Mr. Meredith the story
of your love affair with him in the past.
Get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
me the proof, Lydia&mdash;give me the power to
say this&mdash;and there is nothing you can ask me
that I will not do for you.”</p>

<p>“I will do my best,” said Lydia, “but absolute
proof is difficult to get, you know. One
may be perfectly certain, and yet not have
that.”</p>

<p>“I know,” Percy answered. “But anything
that would give me a hold over that
woman&mdash;” He broke off in his speech, but the
intensity of his tone boded little good to Fanny
Meredith should that hold over her be obtained.
“One thing, at least, is certain,” he resumed
after a moment&mdash;“the man explicitly
denied to you that he had ever been Aimée’s
lover.”</p>

<p>“Explicitly and emphatically.”</p>

<p>“Then that point is number one secured.
This is a good beginning. Continue the work,
Lydia, and let us see how long Mr. Kyrle will
allow himself to be monopolized.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>


<div class="chapter"></div>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>Mr. Kyrle allowed himself to be monopolized
almost unresistingly for several days.
Not indeed as completely as at the Lido, but
to a degree sufficient to prevent any satisfactory
intercourse with Aimée. A sudden passion
for excursions seemed to have seized the
Joscelyns, who had hitherto seen as little as
possible of the different places in which they
had unwillingly sojourned, and who had seemed
quite insensible to any claims of art or history
upon their attention. Now, however, they
discovered that the neighborhood of Venice
abounded in places of interest; and Lydia
arranged one excursion after another to the
adjacent islands, excursions which Kyrle was
invited to join, and during which he was
carefully kept as much as possible apart from
Aimée.</p>

<p>The tactics by which this was managed
were beautifully simple. He found himself
sitting by Miss Joscelyn’s side in a gondola,
carrying her shawl, offering her his arm whenever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
the need for an arm arose, without in
the least understanding how it all came about.
But one of the lookers-on understood perfectly,
and laughed to herself with an amusement
not untinctured by malice. “He declined
my aid,” Mrs. Meredith thought, “so I
shall leave him to Lydia’s mercy. A man,
poor creature, is so helpless in such a case!”</p>

<p>This man was certainly very helpless.
There was not in him any of the tincture of
brutality which exists in men who can release
themselves from such a position by the simplest
and most direct methods. He could not
be deaf when a woman asked for assistance;
he could not refuse to hold a parasol over
her when she requested him to do so, nor
leave her alone when, falling behind the others,
she pleaded fatigue and begged to “rest
a little.” They were all threadbare artifices,
but still strong enough to hold one who to
the instincts of a gentleman in such matters
added a certain hopelessness with regard to
his own affairs. For, after all, he said to himself,
he had made up his mind not to compromise
Aimée by attentions of a loverlike character,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
and it was well that Lydia Joscelyn
should help him to keep this somewhat difficult
resolution.</p>

<p>But it was a resolution which every day
became more difficult, as every day the charm
that breathed from her presence laid deeper
hold upon him. Despite the vigilance of the
Joscelyns, they had occasional opportunities
for conversation, and every such opportunity
seemed to him to strengthen that impression
of a rare individuality which she had from their
first acquaintance made upon him. Now and
then there were glimpses of thoughts and feelings
that lay usually hidden under the gentle
composure with which she met the world;
and these glimpses, he had a fancy, were given
only to him. One of these rare occasions occurred
on an excursion to one of the islands,
where they encountered another group of tourists,
who, proving to be acquaintances, distracted
for a time the attention of the rest of
the party and so made it possible for him to
find Aimée alone. She was sitting, when he
discovered her, under the shadow of the cloisters
belonging to the ancient and partially deserted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
monastic building they were supposed
to be examining, gazing seaward; and as he
approached unobserved, he was struck by the
wistful, almost sad expression of her face. The
expression vanished as she became conscious
of his presence; only a slight shadow still
lingered in her eyes as she turned them on
him. But she spoke, with a smile:</p>

<p>“Does a scene like this,” she said, indicating
the wide, beautiful marine picture spread
before them, “ever rouse in you the expectation
of seeing a sail rise up from ‘the underworld’
bringing some wonderful good fortune
to you? I am always expecting it. I never
look at an ocean horizon without saying to
myself, ‘When will my sail come?’”</p>

<p>“I thought,” he said, as he sat down beside
her, “that your sail had come, bearing
what most people consider the best of good
fortune.”</p>

<p>“You mean money?” she asked. “Yes,
that came to me, and I am not so ungrateful
as to underrate its value, though I can
not say it has done much for me; but I am
not thinking of anything so prosaic, in looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
for my fairy sail. That will bring&mdash;ah,
I know not what, but something that will
give a different meaning to life. All things
seem possible there”&mdash;she waved her hand
toward the distant meeting-place of sea and
sky; “one feels as if everything for which
one longs might come out of that mysterious
distance.”</p>

<p>“But if the magic fortune delays, why not
go in search of it?” Kyrle asked, smiling at
the fancifulness of the talk. “Shall we embark?
Behind that dim line we may find all
that we have lacked in life awaiting us.”</p>

<p>She shook her head. “No,” she answered;
“I have no heart to search the unknown. I
am one of those who can only sit on the shore
and wait the coming of the sail, however much
it may delay.”</p>

<p>Something in her tone, an unconscious
echo of the sadness still lurking in her eyes,
made Kyrle realize more fully than he had
ever done before that her life was certainly
not happy. How, indeed, could happiness in
any positive degree exist in such an environment
as hers? Physical well-being, the comfort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
and luxury of wealth were hers; but what
besides, what love for the tender heart, what
sympathy for the aspiring mind? No wonder
that the dark, wistful eyes sought the horizon
for the magic sail that should bring some
meaning into her colorless days. A rush of
pity made speech impossible to him for several
minutes, and with pity came a longing
like a passion to seize and bear her away from
the odious people who surrounded and preyed
upon her, into the sunshine of such a full and
generous existence as her nature craved. It
was the force of repression which he had to
exert upon himself which made his voice
sound almost stern, as he said:</p>

<p>“The most of us can do little more than
sit on the shore and wait for sails that long
delay in their coming. But I fear that what
we chiefly look for them to bring is that prosaic
fortune which you despise.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” she answered, quickly, “I am not
so foolish nor, as I have said, so ungrateful
as to despise wealth. But if I do not rate
its power as high as most people seem to do,
that is natural. My fortune has really brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
me very little personal good. I have often
thought that I should have been happier
without it. Yet that seems ungrateful; and
my family would think it sheer profanity,” she
added, with a smile.</p>

<p>“I wish,” said Kyrle, with an energy that
was fairly startling, “I wish to Heaven that I
were a rich man! Shall I tell you what I
would do? It is understood that we are in
fairyland, you know. I would have a yacht&mdash;a
very sea-gull for swiftness and beauty&mdash;at my
bidding, and I would take you&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, here she is!” said a voice at a little
distance&mdash;the far from welcome voice of Percy
Joscelyn. “Aimée, we are waiting for you.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It chanced that Kyrle was thinking of this
conversation and all that it had suggested the
next day as, having left the party in a church
engaged in inspecting, with blank amazement,
some frescoes of Carpaccio which Mr. Ruskin
has held up to the admiration of the world,
he went out on the little piazza before the
church and sat down on the steps which led
down to the canal, to wait for them. As he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
sat there in the soft Venetian sunlight he
was of two moods&mdash;one to go quickly, at
once, out of a temptation which had become
overmastering; the other, to cast all scruples
to the winds, and show these people&mdash;who
fancied, forsooth, that their stratagems and
devices had any power to restrain him&mdash;how
little such barriers of straw would stand in
his way did he once resolve to take that way.
Some one, who came quietly out of the church
and sat down beside him, thought that at this
moment he looked more like the old, masterful
Lennox Kyrle than he had looked since
she had seen him under these new conditions.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” said Fanny Meredith, “if you
are by this time aware that you are a very foolish
man?”</p>

<p>He turned and looked at her. “I have
been aware of it for a long time,” he answered,
quietly.</p>

<p>“And is not the knowledge of folly the beginning
of wisdom? Are you not sorry now
that you refused my good offices?”</p>

<p>“Did I refuse them? I am not sure of it.
But, if so, the reason holds good now as then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
which made it impossible for me to accept
them. You urged me to come forward as a
suitor to your cousin, and I told you that I
was too poor a man to think of doing so. My
position has not changed since then.”</p>

<p>“But if you don’t see the folly of <em>that</em>, you
are not at the beginning of wisdom,” said she,
impatiently. “Why, according to your fancy,
only rich people should ever marry rich people;
when, on the contrary, it should really
be the other way! The proper equalizing of
wealth demands that rich persons should marry
poor ones.”</p>

<p>He was not in a mirthful mood, but to
refrain from laughing at this was impossible.
“It is a new thing for you to appear in the
character of a political economist,” he said.
“Your theory is well enough, and I find no
fault with those who practice it. But I must
decline to be one of the poor persons who aid
in the equalization of wealth by such means.”</p>

<p>“Well, <em>I</em> am one of them,” said Fanny,
quite unabashed, turning a diamond ring round
on her finger so that its flashing splendor lent
emphasis to the assertion, “and I can assure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
you that it is a very good means. Pride is
the matter with you,” she went on, remorselessly,
“and I call it a very selfish thing&mdash;much
worse than the mercenary spirit, which I presume
you feel very virtuous in despising! You
don’t deny that you are in love with Aimée;
you dare not say that she is not worth a
thousand times more than her fortune; and
yet you are prepared to let <em>her</em> go, for the
sake of the money you profess to hold in
such scorn, and because the Joscelyns might
call you a fortune-hunter.”</p>

<p>This was certainly very plain speech, and
contained a kernel of truth which struck
Kyrle sharply. “If I have held money in
scorn,” he said, “it has only been with regard
to myself. I know well what its value
is in the eyes of others. And it is true that I
think too much of my own pride, perhaps; but
this is a point on which I have always been
peculiarly sensitive&mdash;”</p>

<p>“As if I did not know that!” she interposed,
with a note of that curious old resentment
against his culpable indifference to mercenary
considerations in her voice. “You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
were so afraid of being suspected of paying
court to your uncle, that you behaved outrageously
to him. Oh, it was a very fine thing
to show your spirit, your independence, your
scorn of groveling souls that cared for money!
So you lost a fortune which a little compliance
with an old man’s whims would have secured
to you; and now you are enjoying the fine
results thereof, and preparing to be guilty of
the same folly, only in an aggravated form,
over again!”</p>

<p>Some people, leaning in the windows of
one of the tall, old houses across the canal, and
watching the little scene curiously, remarked
among themselves that the pretty foreign lady
seemed to be a terrible scold, and that the
poor man&mdash;her husband, probably&mdash;had little
to say under her rating. “He has deserved it,
no doubt,” remarked one woman, enlightened
by her own experience. “It is a case of jealousy,
most likely.”</p>

<p>“What a vindictive creature you are!”
Kyrle was meanwhile saying, with a smile.
“Why can not my old follies&mdash;for which, as
you justly observe, I am now suffering&mdash;be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
allowed to rest? I grant you that I was foolish,
impracticable, full of pride&mdash;”</p>

<p>“As you are yet,” she interpolated.</p>

<p>“Granted again. But a fortune-hunter&mdash;to
be suspected of seeking a woman for her
wealth&mdash;that is something I should feel very
deeply. Yet Miss Vincent is indeed worth so
much more than her fortune, that to speak of
it in connection with her seems an insult. If
she were only rid of it&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But she is not,” said practical Fanny;
“and you can hardly expect her to give it or
throw it away in order to oblige you.”</p>

<p>“I expect nothing,” he answered impatiently.
“And I do not understand why you
should talk as if I had only to put out my hand
and grasp a prize which I am sure would, under
any circumstances, be far beyond my reach.”</p>

<p>“Your humility does you credit,” she said.
“But in my opinion there is no reason why
you should not grasp the prize if you would
only resolve to make the effort. It is not on
your own account that I urge you in this manner,”
she added, quickly, “but because I want
to rescue Aimée. You do not understand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
and <em>she</em> hardly understands, in what a bondage
she is held. If those people can prevent it,
she will never marry anybody, unless it be
Percy Joscelyn. By every possible means
they keep suitors away from her; and if I had
not been here, you would never have been
allowed to approach her near enough to bow
to her. Through me you have a chance that
no other man has had before. But if you are
so blind, if you throw it away for a mere
scruple, if you think more of your own pride
than of saving her&mdash;then you may go! I
have nothing more to say to you.”</p>

<p>She rose as she uttered the last words, and
Kyrle, who had listened to the latter part of
her speech with amazement, could scarcely believe
that it was Fanny Meredith who was
leaving him with such an air of dignity. He
rose too, and made a step after her. There
was a sensible quickening of interest among
the heads at the windows opposite, as the
scene promised to become more dramatic.
“It must be a lover’s quarrel,” some one suggested.
“If he were her husband he would
not follow her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>“Stop a minute,” Kyrle said. “If you
have nothing more to say to me, at least let
me say something to you. I have never
looked at the matter in exactly the light in
which you have put it. But if you will have
patience, if you will give me a little time to
consider, I will tell you my final decision before
to-day is ended.”</p>

<p>“In your place, I would tell mine in five
minutes,” said Fanny, scornfully.</p>

<p>“Very likely,” said he, humbly, “but you
must make allowances for the slowness of the
masculine mind. Can I see you&mdash;will you be
at home this afternoon?”</p>

<p>“No,” she replied, after a moment’s consideration,
“for Mr. Meredith would likely be at
home also, and we could not speak freely.
But you may meet me at the top of the Campanile
about sunset.”</p>

<p>She had hardly said this, and Kyrle had no
more than time to assent, when Miss Joscelyn
emerged from the church and came toward
them with an air of surprise.</p>

<p>“I have been wondering what had become
of Mr. Kyrle,” she said. “You really should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
not have kept him from studying those extraordinary
frescoes of Carpaccio.”</p>

<p>“They are certainly extraordinary,” said
Fanny, dryly, “but I have not kept Mr. Kyrle
from them. I found him here when I came
out for a little relief of sunshine. I hope that
we are done with Carpaccio now, and that we
are going home. It is time for lunch, and I
am hungry.”</p>

<p>This seemed to be the general sentiment of
the party, which, with a somewhat stupefied
appearance&mdash;as of having taken art in rather
too large a dose&mdash;now emerged from the
church. The major was shaking his head.
“Mr. Ruskin is, no doubt, a fine judge of
painting,” he was saying, “but, really&mdash;ah&mdash;hum&mdash;to
send one to see such pictures as
these!”</p>

<p>Aimée, who was walking behind with Percy,
looked tired and pale, and when Kyrle met
her eyes he was about to step to her side, but
a hand was suddenly laid on his arm.</p>

<p>“Do be kind enough to raise this parasol
for me,” said Miss Joscelyn. “The sun is positively
blinding.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>Kyrle raised the parasol, and, accepting his
fate, assisted her into the waiting gondola.
But then, instead of following, he stepped
back, and, lifting his hat quietly, bade the party
adieu “until to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“You will not join us this afternoon?” inquired
Lydia, with some surprise and evident
concern.</p>

<p>“I am sorry that I can not have that pleasure,”
he answered. “I have a budget of correspondence
to read, and another budget to dispatch.”</p>

<p>“Then we will defer the excursion to Murano
till to-morrow,” said she, positively.</p>

<p>Kyrle did not answer, but watched the
gondola, as it moved away, with a very grave
face. The moment of temptation had come
now in earnest. Ought he to think of himself
and his own pride, when it was a question of
rescuing the fair and gentle creature who had
won his heart from such a bondage as that
which Fanny described? If it were true that
by a singular chance he had been enabled to
approach her more nearly than any other man
had ever approached her, or was likely in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
future to do, did it not seem as if Fate pointed
him out as her rescuer? Yet, for him, by
comparison a poor man, to woo so rich a
woman, to meet the insults of her friends, and
bear the brand of a fortune-hunter in the eyes
of the world&mdash;that was a bitter necessity to
face; and, revolving it in his mind, he went
slowly home.</p>

<p>He had been strictly within the limit of
the truth when he told Miss Joscelyn that he
had a budget of correspondence to read, for
the accumulation of several weeks had reached
him only that morning, and he had not taken
time to wade through it before going out.
After a light <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">déjeuner</i>, he set himself to the
task, partly because it was a necessity, and
partly to distract his mind from the question
which he was constantly asking and altogether
unable to answer.</p>

<p>So, after going through several letters with
a very distracted attention, he took up and
opened one which was addressed in a strange
handwriting and bore the stamp of a legal
firm. “How can I&mdash;I, who have nothing!”
was the refrain echoing through his brain as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
he broke the seal. But a minute later he uttered
a great exclamation, and sat staring incredulously
at the paper before him.</p>

<p>Instead of having nothing, this letter informed
him that he possessed a fortune of not
less than a million and a half dollars.</p>

<h3>VIII.</h3>

<p>The sun had set, but there was a radiant
sunset sky, as well as a view of great extent
to be seen from the Campanile as two ladies
stood there, and, leaning over the parapet of
the great tower, looked down on Venice, with
the Grand Canal winding through its midst
like a silver serpent; at the coast of Istria
and the blue summits of the Alps afar; and
at the Adriatic spreading to meet the sky.
One fastened her dark eyes on that distant
line of blending sea and sky, but the other
bestowed her regard chiefly on the Piazza at
her feet, where people seemed to be crawling
about like ants. Presently one of these ants
crossed the square more quickly than the rest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
and entered the loggia at the foot of the
Campanile. Mrs. Meredith looked round at
her companion.</p>

<p>“I think I see Mr. Kyrle coming up,”
she remarked.</p>

<p>Aimée turned with a slight start from the
contemplation of the Adriatic. “How do you
know that it is Mr. Kyrle?” she asked. “It
may be any one.”</p>

<p>“I know because I told him that we were
to be here,” returned the other, carelessly. “I
thought the poor fellow needed a little relief
from the society of Lydia. He really begins
to look worn and pale under the ordeal.”</p>

<p>“I can not see why you should draw such
a conclusion,” said Aimée. “If he did not
like Lydia’s society, he need not endure it. A
man can do what he likes in such matters.”</p>

<p>“Simpleton! is that all you know about
it?” said Fanny. “Why, unless he absolutely
runs away, a man is helpless in the hands of
a woman who knows how to play such a game
as Lydia is playing. And this man does not
want to run away, because he adores <em>you</em>.”</p>

<p>“Fanny!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is quite true. He adores you, and yet
he is so afraid of your fortune that he dare
not approach you. He does not believe that
a poor man has any right to try to marry a
rich woman.”</p>

<p>A flush that seemed borrowed from the
sunset was now on Aimée’s face. She cast a
glance of reproach at her cousin.</p>

<p>“If it is true,” she said, hurriedly, “why
have you chosen such a time to speak of it?”</p>

<p>“Because I thought it only a matter of justice
to let you know that he does not endure
Lydia’s attentions because he likes them,” replied
Fanny, coolly.</p>

<p>They were silent then, for steps were now
heard inside the tower, ascending that inclined
plane up which tradition tells that Napoleon
rode his horse; and a little later Kyrle stepped
on the platform.</p>

<p>The moment he appeared, Fanny Meredith
saw that there was a change in him&mdash;a
glow in his sunburned cheek, a light in his
eye, and the air of a man who had burst some
bond. She looked at him with surprise, and as
he walked up to her&mdash;not seeing Aimée, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
had retreated to the other side of the tower&mdash;she
said, involuntarily:</p>

<p>“What is the matter? You look&mdash;unlike
yourself.”</p>

<p>“Do I?” he said, with a thrill of excitement
in his voice. “Well, that is not strange.
I am <em>not</em> myself&mdash;that is, I am not the man
you parted with this morning, but quite another.
Allow me to introduce myself to you
as a millionaire.”</p>

<p>She gave a cry, and clasped her hands.
“Your uncle is dead, and has left you his
money, after all!” she exclaimed. “O Lennox,
I am so glad!” Then she turned swiftly
and ran across the platform. “O Aimée!”
she cried, “you must congratulate Mr. Kyrle.
He has just come into a large fortune.”</p>

<p>When Aimée turned, she and Lennox were
both pale&mdash;he, because he had not entertained
the least expectation of finding her there; and
she, on account of this unexpected sequel to
those last words of Fanny’s, which were still
ringing in her ears.</p>

<p>“I hope Mr. Kyrle will accept my congratulations,”
she said, “although”&mdash;and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
smiled a faint, tremulous smile&mdash;“I am not
sure that to inherit a great deal of money is
always such good fortune as the world believes.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” said Fanny, “such skepticism may
do for people who have inherited it. But I
do not think Mr. Kyrle will quarrel with his
good fortune.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Lennox, quietly, “I would be
very far from quarreling with it&mdash;if it were
really mine.”</p>

<p>“If it were really yours!” repeated Mrs.
Meredith, recoiling a step in her amazement
and disappointment. “What do you mean?”</p>

<p>Lennox looked at Aimée. “I will tell
you,” he replied, “what I mean. When I said,
a moment ago, that I am a millionaire, I said
what is exactly true; and ever since I read
the letter announcing the news to me I have
been playing with the sensation, with the idea,
of being rich and free, and altogether living
in a fool’s paradise. For”&mdash;his voice changed&mdash;“it
is true that the fortune is mine, but it
is also true that I can not retain it.”</p>

<p>“Good Heaven! why not?” cried Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
Meredith; while Aimée said nothing, but
looked at him with all her soul in her eyes;
and he, gazing into those eyes, answered:</p>

<p>“Because it is by an accident, not by the
intention of my uncle, that I inherit this fortune.
It has long been his intention, of which
I was well aware, to found with his wealth
some great charity to perpetuate his name,
and his will to that effect was drawn up many
years ago. Lately he wished to alter it in
some particulars, and directed his lawyer to
draw up a new will according to his directions.
Before this will could be signed he
died suddenly of apoplexy, and the older will
having been destroyed, I inherit the property
as nearest of kin.”</p>

<p>“Now, I call that providential!” said Fanny,
in a tone of devout thanksgiving. “I do not
know when I have heard anything that gives
me so much pleasure! To think of that old&mdash;ahem&mdash;gentleman
being so outwitted at last,
and so thwarted in his desire to cheat you!
For I call it absolute cheating, when a man
leaves his property away from his nearest relative
and natural heir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>“Opinions differ on that point,” said Lennox.
“I hold that a man’s property is his
own, to do with what he will; provided, of
course, that he does not neglect his duty to his
<ins class="corr" id="tn227" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Period added after “children”">children</ins>. But that duty does not extend to a
nephew, especially one who declined all that
he offered, and chose another path in life.
No, it seems to me that my plain duty is to
regard that unsigned will as a valid instrument,
and to execute it.”</p>

<p>There was a minute’s silence after he finished,
for both of his hearers were completely
taken by surprise. Fanny Meredith fairly
gasped with amazement before she cried:</p>

<p>“Why, it is worse than quixotism&mdash;it is
absolute madness! I have never heard of
such a thing in my life! What you threw
away before, when you went against your uncle’s
wishes, was bad enough; but this&mdash;!”
Words failed her: tears absolutely came into
her eyes. “O Lennox,” she said, imploringly,
“you surely will not do it!&mdash;Aimée, for
Heaven’s sake, speak to him! He will listen
to you!”</p>

<p>Aimée flushed, but Lennox turned to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
quickly. His face was set in resolute lines,
but there was something in his eyes&mdash;a wistful,
pathetic expression, as of one asking help&mdash;which
touched her deeply.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” he said, simply, “am I not
right?”</p>

<p>It was a subject on which few people
would have cared to offer advice, unless, like
Fanny Meredith, they offered it on the side of
worldly common-sense; but Aimée did not
hesitate. She answered as simply and directly
as he had asked:</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;as far as I can judge, I think that
you are right.”</p>

<p>Fanny Meredith threw up her hands, as if
appealing to earth and heaven against such
folly.</p>

<p>“I think you are both mad,” she said,
“and I really feel constrained to seek some
saner society.”</p>

<p>With this, before either could utter a word
or make the least effort to detain her, she had
turned and fled. For an instant they stood
confounded, listening to the sound of her
flying feet down that incline which is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
veritable “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">facilis descensus</i>.” Then murmuring
something quickly, Aimée made a motion
to follow; but the consciousness of being a
millionaire, were it only for an hour, gave
Lennox courage and resolution.</p>

<p>“Pray do not go,” he said, earnestly; “she
will be back presently, or&mdash;we can follow her.
But first I must speak to you; I wish to ask
your advice.”</p>

<p>“I scarcely think that I am fitted to advise
you,” she said, pausing at his request, but
looking away from him.</p>

<p>“You are eminently fitted,” he replied,
“because your opinion is of infinite value to
me, and your approval worth more to me
than that of any one else in the world. Indeed,
if <em>you</em> approve, I care not who else disapproves.”
He stopped for an instant, then
quickly went on: “I thank God that the
temptation to keep this money has not overpowered
me, for it has been great. Do you
know why? Because it seemed to put within
my reach a prize which before had seemed as
far from me as heaven; at least, it made effort
possible, it gave me leave <em>to try</em>. Before, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
could I, how dared I, think of saying to
one dowered like a princess, ‘I love you’?
But if, with this fortune in my hand, I said
it, no one could doubt my sincerity, no one
could think that I sought her for anything
save herself&mdash;herself, so far above all that a
man could offer or give, that if he brought the
wealth of the world he would still be unworthy
of her!”</p>

<p>He paused, overpowered by his own emotion,
and hardly expecting an answer from
Aimée. He could not see her face, for she
had turned away from him, but he saw that
she was trembling, and he was amazed by the
clear steadiness of the voice in which she
spoke after a moment.</p>

<p>“What a man could say with a fortune in
his hand, he might surely&mdash;unless he thought
more of money than of his own manhood&mdash;say
without it.”</p>

<p>“May I?” he cried, almost incredulously.
“You will let me say it&mdash;I, who had nothing
yesterday, and will have nothing to-morrow!&mdash;you
will let me tell you that I love you
with all my heart?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>Another pause, and then&mdash;“If that be true,”
said the sweet voice, “why should it matter
that you had nothing yesterday or that you
will have nothing to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“It matters,” he answered, “in the opinion
of the world, which is quick to say of such a
man&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But, a moment ago, I thought that it
was my opinion alone which mattered,” she
interposed.</p>

<p>“It <em>is</em> yours&mdash;yours alone,” he replied.
“And if you tell me that I may hope, the
scorn of the whole world can not hold me
back from striving to win you.”</p>

<p>She turned a beautiful, smiling face toward
him. “It seems to me,” she said, “that a man
who possesses or who has refused a fortune
of a million or two can hardly fear that his
disinterestedness could be questioned. But I”&mdash;her
voice sank a little&mdash;“I do not think I
should have needed the test.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mrs. Meredith, sitting quietly below in the
loggia of Sansovino, grew rather tired of waiting
before the two from above came down to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
seek her. She rose, and looked at them with
a smile.</p>

<p>“Well,” she said, innocently, “have you settled
the matter? Is the fortune to be given
up, or retained?”</p>

<p>“The fortune!” said Kyrle. “I had forgotten
it; but, of course, it is to be given up.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Mrs. Meredith. She looked
at him curiously, this man who was capable
of such wild quixotism, and said to herself
that certainly things were better as they were.
There was no danger that Mr. Meredith would
ever be troubled by any scruples which would
cause him to resign <em>his</em> fortune. Then she
shrugged her shoulders gently. “I suppose it
is quite useless to argue with you,” she said,
“but, at least, the fortune has done you a good
turn, and I advise you to say nothing to any
one else of your intention of resigning it. <em>Do</em>
the thing, if you like, when you return to
America, but don’t talk of it now. It is yours
until you choose to give it away, so pray take
the great advantage it will give you.”</p>

<p>She did not say in what way, but Kyrle
knew to what she alluded; he knew that this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
wealth would render it difficult for the Joscelyns
to object to him. He looked doubtfully
at Aimée.</p>

<p>“That,” he said, “would seem like sailing
under false colors; or, at least, like winning
what I most desire by a false representation.”</p>

<p>“Now, Heaven grant me patience!” said
Mrs. Meredith, impatiently. “But is not the
fortune yours?”</p>

<p>“For the present, yes,” he answered.</p>

<p>“Then, why on earth should you take people
who are not your friends into your confidence
with regard to what you mean to do
with it?”</p>

<p>“Simply,” he replied, “because those people
have a right to know what is my true position
in life, and an accident like my uncle’s
unsigned will does not affect that position.
Am I not right?” said he, turning to Aimée.</p>

<p>“I think that you are,” she answered,
quietly.</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Mrs. Meredith, “go your
own way. I wash my hands of you both;
but I am very sure that before you are done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
with this affair you will wish that you had
followed my advice.”</p>



<div class="chapter"></div>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>IX.</h3>

<p>The event more than justified this prediction.
The storm which burst when Kyrle
proposed himself to Major and Mrs. Joscelyn
as a suitor for Aimée was such as the latter,
with all her experience, had never known before.
They would not have received the proposal
of a prince had it been possible to
refuse it, for they were resolutely determined
to retain control of the heiress and her fortune.
But a man who by his own acknowledgment
had nothing, yet was capable of
throwing away a million or more dollars&mdash;words
were too weak to express their opinion
of him! They rejected his suit with scorn,
and the major grew fairly inarticulate when
trying to express himself with regard to such
unparalleled audacity.</p>

<p>A penny-a-liner, a scribbler for newspapers,
possessing not a dollar in property, yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
so insane as to refuse a fortune for an absurd
scruple! By Jove, a raving maniac would be
as suitable a match! Never should Aimée
throw herself away in such a manner&mdash;never!
If it were necessary, they would constrain her
for her own good. She should not wreck her
life and her fortune by marrying a madman.</p>

<p>But the time had come when they were to
learn what was in Aimée. She had so submissively
yielded to their demands hitherto
that they expected her to yield now; but it
was characteristic of her that the strength
which her nature possessed only manifested
itself on rare and supreme occasions, so that
she now and then took even those who knew
her best by surprise. She certainly took her
tyrants by surprise on this occasion. Quietly,
but steadily, she faced them like a rock.</p>

<p>“I shall marry Mr. Kyrle,” she said. “I
am sorry if my choice does not meet with my
mother’s approval; but it is a matter which
concerns myself alone, and I can not suffer
dictation with regard to it.”</p>

<p>The major stormed, Mrs. Joscelyn tried
tears and entreaties, culminating in hysterics,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
but Aimée remained unmoved. She calmly
repeated her ultimatum, and left them.</p>

<p>Then, in view of the gravity of the situation,
another family council was held. Percy
came, pale and venomous with the shock of
hearing that his worst fears had been realized,
and Lydia with a suspicious redness around
her eyes. She not only shrank in anticipation
from the bitterness of her brother’s taunts and
reproaches upon the failure of her effort to
attract Kyrle, but there was a sting in the failure
itself, for her fancy was of the order that
went out to any man who approached her, and
her eagerness to detain the young correspondent
at her side had not been dictated only by
regard for the family interest.</p>

<p>Percy condescended to throw her but one
stinging word. “I was a fool to trust to such
poor arts as yours,” he said. “Of course, the
man was only amusing himself with your vanity
and laughing in his sleeve at all of us. You
have failed totally in keeping him from Aimée;
have you succeeded better in discovering anything
about his past relations with Mrs. Meredith?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>She shook her head. “No,” she answered,
in a crestfallen tone. “I have never been able
to draw anything from him, though I have
tried. But I am sure that I am right&mdash;that
there was something between them in the
past!”</p>

<p>“So am I,” he retorted, “but what good is
there in being sure when one has no proof?
You might have got that out of him if you
had done no more! But, even without proof,
I have made up my mind to see what can be
accomplished by threatening Mrs. Meredith
with exposure. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Toujours l’audace!</i> She may
believe that I know everything. Heavens! if
I only did&mdash;”</p>

<p>He glared at poor Lydia as if it were her
fault that he did not, then turned abruptly to
his father. “If I fail in what I am going to
try,” he said, “we must adopt a policy of
stratagem. Drop all appearance of opposition,
but insist upon returning at once to
Paris. The first and essential thing is to separate
Aimée from the Merediths. Separating
her afterward from Kyrle will be comparatively
easy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>“She is&mdash;ah&mdash;um&mdash;very determined,” said
the major.</p>

<p>“So is every girl who fancies herself in
love; what does that matter? She will learn
that her determination must bend before ours.
For myself, I will hesitate at <em>no</em> means to accomplish
this. Are you not ready to say the
same?”</p>

<p>Under the challenge of that domineering
and unscrupulous glance the major fidgeted,
cleared his throat nervously, but finally spoke.
“Yes,” he said, “I think that any means
would be&mdash;ah&mdash;justifiable, to prevent a thing
so mad as what she declares her intention of
doing.”</p>

<p>“Then everything is settled,” said Percy,
with sharp decision. “Make preparations for
leaving Venice immediately. Whether I succeed
or fail with Mrs. Meredith, that must
be done. Give Aimée no excuse for refusing
to go. Promise anything now. Once
away, she will be in our hands, and the rest is
easy.”</p>

<p>Even Lydia shuddered a little at the last
words. To be in Percy’s hands, at Percy’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
mercy, was surely a fate not to be desired,
and that, she knew, was what it meant; for
he ruled them all, and his father and stepmother
would consent to whatever he proposed.
With the last words he rose.</p>

<p>“Now,” he said, “I am going to try intimidation
with Mrs. Meredith. If I succeed, our
work will be easier; if I fail, nothing will be
lost. In any event, we go.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Fanny Meredith was walking restlessly
about her sitting-room, waiting for the news
from Aimée, which Aimée had not yet come
to give. Lennox had looked in after his interview
with Major and Mrs. Joscelyn, made his
report, received the sarcastic congratulations of
his ally on having brought about exactly the
result she had predicted, and which she supposed
he had desired, and then taken his departure&mdash;for
he felt as if solitude was at that
moment the only thing he craved&mdash;solitude to
dwell upon the look and the tone of Aimée
when she put her hand in his as he was going,
and said: “Do not let any of this trouble you.
I shall not change.” Change! He could have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
laughed at their folly in fancying they could
change her. How well he knew that light in
the brave, dark eyes, and the unflinching resolution
which it indicated!</p>

<p>After his departure, Fanny looked for
Aimée to appear shortly; but as time went
on and she did not come, Mrs. Meredith grew
restless and impatient. What was the matter?
Even her courage shrank from bearding the
lion in his den&mdash;that is, the enraged family in
their own apartments; but she decided that if
Aimée did not come soon, she would go and
learn what detained her. It was just after this
resolution had been formed that a knock at
the door was followed by the appearance of
Percy Joscelyn.</p>

<p>He was perfectly calm in outward bearing,
but his quietness of manner did not deceive
Fanny for a moment. She knew in the first
glance of his eye that he had come for war,
and she felt at once scornfully ready to meet
it. What could Percy Joscelyn say that would
matter to her? She threw back her head and
met him with the weapon that always came to
her most readily, that of mockery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, Percy,” she said, “this is a very
unexpected pleasure. It is not often you are
good enough to come to see me alone. But I
suppose you want to talk over such an interesting
event as Aimée’s engagement.”</p>

<p>“Not exactly,” replied Percy, blandly,
though his glance became more venomous
than ever. “I do not consider that Aimée’s engagement
can take place without the consent
of her parents and guardians; but I wish to
congratulate you on your success in getting
rid of an old lover who might tell awkward
stories, by the simple expedient of stopping
his mouth with an heiress.”</p>

<p>There was a moment’s pause. The gauntlet
had been flung down, and he stood with
his hand on the back of a chair, waiting to see
how she would take it up. As for Fanny, astonishment
rather than lack of courage held
her silent for the short space of time in which
they regarded each other. Then she said, with
more dignity than any one could have imagined
her capable of displaying:</p>

<p>“So you have come simply to insult me.
That, at least, makes matters clear. I understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
and can allow much for your disappointment
with regard to Aimée; but I do
not intend to listen to such insinuations as
you have just uttered. Be good enough to
leave my room.”</p>

<p>She lifted her hand and pointed to the
door, but Joscelyn did not stir. On the contrary,
he held his position with an air of determination,
as he held her glance by the steadiness
of his own.</p>

<p>“It will not be well,” he said, “for you
to insist upon my leaving before I have finished
what I have come to say. I know that
Kyrle was your lover before you were married,
and that you jilted him for a richer man.
In order to deceive that man, you have represented
him as having been the lover of
Aimée. This is a pretense which might blind
Mr. Meredith, but nobody else; and I hardly
think it would blind <em>him</em> very long if one took
the trouble to tell him the truth. Now, I do
not propose that Aimée shall be bargained
away to save your secrets, so I plainly give
you your choice: send this fellow away, as I
have no doubt you have the power to do, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
Mr. Meredith shall know the whole truth
about him and you!”</p>

<p>“My dear,” said Fanny Meredith afterward,
in describing the scene to Aimée, “I
was astonished at myself. You know I always
was a coward, and I had no doubt that
the horrid wretch did know everything, as he
said, and would tell it to Tom. But, for the
life of me, I <em>could not</em> quail before him! I felt
such contempt for him, and such a sense of
outrage that he should dare to threaten me
in that manner, that I suppose it was anger
that made me as brave as a lion.”</p>

<p>Whatever was the force supplying courage,
whether anger or disdain, she did not exaggerate
in saying that she showed no sign of
quailing before Percy Joscelyn’s threats. She
drew her brows together, and her eyes blazed
as they looked at him. In that instant he
felt that he had made a mistake&mdash;that to intimidate
this woman was not possible.</p>

<p>“What a contemptible creature you are,”
she said, in a clear, vibrating tone, “and what
a fool besides, to think that you could accomplish
anything with <em>me</em> by such a method as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
this! I will not condescend to answer your
insolent assertions and insinuations. If you
can induce my husband to listen to you, you
can tell him what you please. But understand
once for all that every effort in my power shall
be devoted to helping Lennox Kyrle to rescue
Aimée from any further association with such
a person as yourself. Now will you go&mdash;or
shall I be forced to ring for the servants to
put you out of my apartment?”</p>

<p>Brave as a lion she surely was, or she
would have shrunk from the impotent and
vindictive rage that almost convulsed Percy’s
countenance as he looked at her. There was
little in his power to give which he would
not have given at this moment to be able to
crush her by some revelation such as he had
hinted at, but which he now began to think
had no existence in reality; for it seemed to
him impossible that any one whose conscience
convicted her of the falsity charged, could
have been so daring and defiant. No, he had
made a mistake, and yet&mdash;</p>

<p>What was this? Why did Fanny’s expression
change so suddenly and greatly?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
Why did something like fear&mdash;yes, he could
not be mistaken, it <em>was</em> fear&mdash;come into her
eyes, as she looked past him at the door to
which she had again haughtily directed him?
He turned quickly and faced Mr. Meredith,
who paused astonished at the angry scene before
him.</p>

<p>“Fanny!” he said, involuntarily addressing
his wife.</p>

<p>Fanny felt as if her last hour had come, but
to betray this to Percy Joscelyn was impossible!
The spirit that was in her still kept her
head erect and her manner dauntless, although
it had not been able to keep from her eyes
that sudden expression of fear which had
leaped into them. She now addressed her
husband with admirable composure, notwithstanding
that there was a perceptible quiver
of excitement in her voice.</p>

<p>“I have just requested Mr. Joscelyn to
leave the room,” she said. “He has so forgotten
himself, under the disappointment of
Aimée’s engagement, that he has ventured to
come here and threaten me&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Threaten you!” repeated Mr. Meredith,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
as she paused. He made a stride forward that
brought him close to Percy Joscelyn, and then
he stopped, controlling himself by an effort,
but with all its usual genial expression gone
from his face, and, instead, fierce indignation in
every line. “What is the meaning of this?”
he asked, sternly. “Explain yourself!”</p>

<p>A bitter sneer curled the other’s lip. He
could not, indeed, explain himself as he should
have liked to do; he could not explicitly charge
Fanny with duplicity which he only suspected,
but he could at least throw a firebrand, and
make, he fondly hoped, trouble between herself
and her husband. So it was that the sneer
came as he looked at that gentleman.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Meredith seems to have regarded it
as a threat,” he said, “that I requested her to
use her influence over her old lover to induce
him to relinquish his fortune-hunting scheme
with regard to Aimée, or else I should have
the pleasure of enlightening you with regard
to some episodes of her past connected with
that gentleman.”</p>

<p>It was a desperate venture, this speech, for
if he had been asked for the episodes&mdash;&mdash;But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
he fancied that he knew Tom Meredith too
well to fear that, and the event proved him
right. Mr. Meredith did not glance at his
wife at all, but looked at Joscelyn himself with
lowering brows and gleaming eyes.</p>

<p>“You are a cowardly cur!” he said, distinctly.
“My wife told you to leave the room.
I now repeat the advice; and if you do not
follow it instantly, I shall be obliged to kick
you out!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“O Tom, Tom,” cried Fanny, hysterically,
“how good you were not even to gratify the
wretch by listening to him!”</p>

<p>“Is it possible that you could have imagined
that I would?” her husband asked.
“Then I can only say that you don’t know me
very well yet. Even if I had believed what he
implied, do you think I would have let <em>him</em>
know it? But how did such an idea enter
his mind?” he inquired after a moment, as he
sat down. “Is he not aware that Mr. Kyrle
was Aimée’s lover long ago?”</p>

<p>Fanny stood silent, motionless, incapable, it
seemed to her, of movement or speech. Never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
had that old falsehood, told so lightly and
heedlessly in the past, appeared to her so odious,
so black, so dishonorable as now! Oh,
what a vile return for her husband’s trust and
goodness to let him still be deceived, still
believe a thing which was not so, still be less
wise (so she fancied) than Percy Joscelyn, still
think her better than she was! No, if it lost
her his love forever, if he never, never forgave
her the long deceit, she would tell him
the truth <em>now</em>, while she had the saving grace
and courage to speak. Perhaps Mr. Meredith
had never in his life been more surprised
than when she suddenly rushed forward, sank
on her knees by his chair, and burst into
tears.</p>

<p>“O Tom,” she said, “I don’t know that
you will ever forgive me for having deceived
you so long, but I <em>must</em> tell the truth! Lennox
Kyrle was never Aimée’s lover at all.
He was mine.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>



<div class="chapter"></div>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>X.</h3>

<p>“And he took it like an angel, my dear,”
Mrs. Meredith said to Aimée a few hours later.
“I never have credited Tom with any angelic
qualities before, but I see now that it was because
I did not do him justice. No one could
have been kinder. He seemed really touched
that I confided in him at last, only, he said,
it was a mistake not to have told the truth at
the time; and he was very severe about the
false position in which you were placed. But
I cried&mdash;Heavens, how I cried!&mdash;so he could
not scold very much; and then he said he appreciated
my telling the truth because it was
entirely a voluntary act, since he was sure I
did him the justice to believe he would never
have listened to Percy Joscelyn. I <em>did</em> believe
it, and that was the reason I was forced
to speak. When he trusted me so, I was
ashamed to feel how I had deceived him!”</p>

<p>“I have often wondered,” said Aimée,
“that you did not feel it before.”</p>

<p>“No doubt I ought to have done so,” replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
Fanny, penitently, “and perhaps I suffered
more than you would believe; for I
feel now as light&mdash;oh, as light as a feather,
to think that there is no more need for concealment.
Lennox will be glad. He was
always so desperately indignant about you.
I really believe that he fell in love with you
at that time.”</p>

<p>Aimée smiled a little. Probably Lennox
had already told her so.</p>

<p>“And what a pleasant <ins class="corr" id="tn250" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Double quote added after “And what a pleasant thing it is,”">thing it is</ins>,” Mrs.
Meredith went on, “to reflect that this is the
only result of Percy’s attempt to make mischief&mdash;the
viper! Aimée, do you know that
there are dreadful possibilities of malice in
that man? I shudder when I remember the
expression of his face as he stood there”&mdash;she
pointed to the spot&mdash;“looking at me.
And what makes me shudder, is the thought
of his having any power over you.”</p>

<p>“He has none at all,” said Aimée, a little
haughtily. “What is Percy Joscelyn to me?”</p>

<p>“To <em>you</em>?&mdash;nothing. But he directs every
act of your mother and stepfather, and therefore
he has a dangerous power over your life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
I tell you frankly that I shall never feel that
you are safe until you are married and out of
their clutches.”</p>

<p>“Safe from what?” asked Aimée, quietly.</p>

<p>“Well,” answered Fanny, reluctantly, “I
don’t want to be melodramatic, or I should
say safe from danger. I believe Percy to be
capable of any wickedness. I did not think
so until to-day. Hitherto I have thought him
more mean than wicked, but it was as if I
looked down into his soul when he stood
there gazing at me with hatred in his eyes,
and what I saw there was as black as&mdash;as the
bottomless pit!”</p>

<p>“Fanny!” said Aimée, astonished and startled,
for this flight of imagination was singularly
unlike Fanny, who generally took things
on the surface, and was not at all addicted to
descending in fancy to the region of which
she spoke.</p>

<p>“I mean exactly what I say, my dear,” replied
her cousin, with energy. “I assure you
that I wish I could see you married to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“It would have to be an elopement, then,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
said Aimée, with something between a smile
and a sob, “for I have just been informed that
we are to return to Paris to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Aimée!” It was fairly a scream that
Mrs. Meredith gave. “You will not <em>dream</em> of
consenting to go?”</p>

<p>“What reason have I for refusing?” the
girl asked, wistfully. “I can not, without some
reason, positively decline to accompany my
mother. I have told them that I shall certainly
marry Mr. Kyrle; but that has nothing
to do with returning to Paris.”</p>

<p>“It has everything to do with it!” said
Fanny, in great excitement. “Why else should
they think of taking you away in this manner?
I tell you that they will hesitate at
nothing when they have you alone with them.
Aimée, <em>you must not go</em>.”</p>

<p>“What would you have me do, then?”
asked Aimée.</p>

<p>“I would have you come with us.” (It
had long been settled that the Merediths
were to go from Venice to Vienna, while the
question whether or not the Joscelyns should
accompany them had been left open.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>“They would never consent,” said Aimée,
“and I can not endure the thought of a
struggle. When the time comes to part from
them I should like it to be in outward peace
at least.”</p>

<p>“That can never be,” said Fanny, resolutely.
“Do not hope for it. They will never let you
and your fortune go without a struggle. The
only thing to do is to get this struggle over
at once. Come with us and marry Lennox
Kyrle in Vienna. Don’t tell me that you are
not brave enough for it! I am sure that you
are brave enough for anything.”</p>

<p>“Brave enough to face danger&mdash;yes,” said
Aimée, simply, “but not brave enough to face
struggle, pain, bitterness&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But you must face all those things if you
remain with them, unless you buy peace by
giving up Lennox Kyrle. For&mdash;do not deceive
yourself&mdash;they will never consent to your
marrying him; and if you are resolved to do
it, you must at last leave them in a more unpleasant
manner than this which I propose.
Now, there is not the slightest difficulty about
it, but if you were alone with them would it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
be easy? I fear that it might be impossible,
and I should not be there to help you.”</p>

<p>“It is true,” said Aimée, who was pale and
greatly shaken. “It might be necessary hereafter&mdash;under
worse circumstances.”</p>

<p>“It <em>would</em> be necessary, and might be impossible,”
said Fanny. “Do you not see?
This is the golden opportunity. Ah!”&mdash;she
rose quickly and ran to the window&mdash;“I see
some one who will help me.”</p>

<p>She waved her hand to Kyrle, whose gondola
was just drawing to the steps of the
hotel. A moment later he was in the apartment
and ready to second her proposal with
all the eloquence that love could inspire. But
even his eloquence might not have moved
Aimée if she had not felt that he was right;
that she was merely on the threshold of a
struggle in which she might be worsted, since
her opponents would be absolutely unscrupulous
in the use of means. But Fanny and
Lennox appreciated this, and both were earnest
in urging her to take <em>now</em> a step which
must be taken sooner or later.</p>

<p>But she was still undecided, when an unexpected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
ally to the attacking force appeared
on the scene. Mr. Meredith came in, and
when he heard of the plan of the Joscelyns
his honest wrath was stirred. “What! they
propose to leave to-morrow, and carry you
away with them?” he said. “Then there is one
simple thing to be done: I shall go at once
and engage your passage with us on the Trieste
boat which leaves to-night.”</p>

<p>Aimée rose and went up to him. The
opinions of the others had not moved her as
much as might have been expected. Fanny,
she knew, was always inimical to the Joscelyns,
and for Fanny’s judgment she had not great
respect, while Lennox labored under the disadvantage
of being a lover who appealed to
her heart. In yielding to him she felt that she
would be yielding to those dangerous guides,
the feelings. But if this practical, unsentimental
man thought she ought to go, that
was a different matter. She laid her hand on
his arm, and looked at him with her dark, appealing
eyes.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” she said, “do you think I ought
to go?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>The appeal of her tone was as great as the
appeal of her glance; and the simplicity of her
words touched the man whom she addressed
more than anything impassioned could have
done.</p>

<p>“My dear,” he said, kindly, “I think that, if
you are determined to marry this gentleman,
the wisest thing you can do is to leave your
family at once, for it will come to that at last;
and there is not only no good in deferring an
evil day, but at another time you might not
be able to command the protection which I
am happy to offer you now.”</p>

<p>“Just what I have told her,” cried Fanny.&mdash;“Now,
Aimée, will you consent to go?”</p>

<p>Aimée’s glance passed wistfully from one
to the other, and rested on Lennox. “Yes,”
she said at length, “I will go.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Out into the night and the sea the steamer
was moving, leaving the wonderful lights of
Venice&mdash;a vision of an enchanted city&mdash;behind,
while among the passengers on her decks
one group of four persons watched rather silently
the lessening radiance. They were all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
somewhat subdued in feeling by the fierce
storm of opposition through which they had
passed&mdash;a storm that had shaken Aimée to
the very center, yet had showed her the absolute
necessity of this step. She stood now
leaning on Kyrle’s arm, her gentle soul filled
with sadness at the thought of the bitterness
and anger she had left behind, although beneath
the sadness was a consciousness of freedom
of release from bondage such as she had
never felt before. Presently her spirit would
spread its wings like a bird in the sunshine,
exulting in this new atmosphere; but now she
was silent, and Kyrle, divining what she was
thinking, as well as her physical exhaustion
after such stress of emotion, uttered himself
no word, only pressed close against his heart
the little hand resting on his arm. It was
Fanny Meredith who said at last, with a sigh
of relief:</p>

<p>“Well, thank Heaven, it is over, and we
are safe; but I feel as if we had <em>all</em> eloped.&mdash;Don’t
you, Tom?”</p>

<p>“I can’t say that I do,” her husband answered,
with a laugh. “But, by Jove, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
were desperate! The major swore he would
lock her up, and I swore that if he did I would
break down the door. I should have done it,
too, without a moment’s hesitation,” the speaker
ended.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t it have been simpler and less
sensational to call in the police?” Fanny
asked.</p>

<p>“The police!” Mr. Meredith scornfully
blew out a cloud of cigar-smoke. “What the
deuce could Italian police do in such a case?
They would probably have arrested everybody,
and kept us in Venice until proof could have
been given of Aimée’s age, and a lot of other
nonsense. Do you suppose the Joscelyns
would have hesitated to declare that she was
still an infant? No; the simple and direct
thing to do was what we did&mdash;carry her off by
armed force.”</p>

<p>“What was it you said to Percy Joscelyn
when he followed us to the gondola?” Fanny
inquired of Kyrle.</p>

<p>“I told him that if he came a step farther
I should pitch him into the canal,” that gentleman
answered. “Probably he was aware that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
it would give me sincere pleasure to do it, for
he drew back.”</p>

<p>“And yet people think that a fortune is a
blessing!” said Aimée, with a long, quivering
breath. “How gladly they would have let me
go&mdash;as they did once&mdash;if it were not for my
money! I felt like casting it to them, and bidding
them take the only thing they cared for!”</p>

<p>“I am very glad you did not,” said Fanny,
practically. “They would have certainly taken
it, and you have already cast them far too
much. Don’t abuse your fortune, my dear, because
the Joscelyns are despicable. Money is
a good, a very good thing to have. I only
wish you could make Lennox believe it!”</p>

<p>Kyrle laughed. The strain of emotion
was sufficiently relaxed now for laughter to
become easy. “I promise,” he said, “to do
exactly what she wishes with regard to my
fortune.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” replied Fanny, pettishly, “you only
say that because you know she is as absurdly
quixotic as yourself. It may be a very fine
thing to be able to throw fortunes away,” the
speaker pursued, “but I am glad Tom has no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
temptations of the kind.&mdash;Come,” she said,
taking that gentleman’s arm, “I begin to feel
the swell a little. Let us walk.”</p>

<p>They passed down the deck, and the two
left alone together stood silent for a moment,
still watching the lessening lights of the fairy-like
city. Then Kyrle turned his face seaward,
to meet the fresh breeze that came from the
wide sweep of the Adriatic, and his heart
leaped within him, as if in answer to that
boundless freedom of the sea.</p>

<p>“This is not exactly the sea-gull yacht in
which I longed to carry you away,” he said to
his companion, “but, although less poetical, it
is still bearing us toward the region of our
dreams&mdash;that mysterious distance out of which
it seemed possible that all things might come.”</p>

<p>“<em>You</em> came out of it,” said Aimée, with a
sound as of a smile in her voice. “How well
I remember the night on the sea wall of St.
Augustine, when I waited for the sound of
your oars, and presently you came from the
sea, as now&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Now I am going back to it&mdash;with you,”
he said, as she paused. “There has been a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
interval between the beginning and the end of
the romance; but it is fitting that the sea,
which had a part in its beginning, should also
